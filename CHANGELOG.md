# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once a first tagged release ships.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **New `beach` overlay style.** A scoreboard layout tailored for beach
  volleyball: the two teams sit on the left and right of a horizontal bar
  with the set score in the centre rendered as a white card with large
  black numerals (deliberately the biggest element on the board), a
  sun-yellow serving indicator and timeout pips, and optional team logos.
  Auto-discovered by the overlay engine (`overlay_templates/beach.html` +
  `overlay_static/css/beach.css`), so it appears in the style picker and
  is selectable per overlay like any other style.

### Fixed

- **Set-summary recap overlay overflowed with point-type stats.** The
  per-point breakdown was added to the recap as one stat row per type,
  which overran the fixed-size stat panels (services wrapped, the
  opponent-errors row was clipped off the bottom). It now renders as a
  bounded compact chip strip — short label + count per type, zeros
  dimmed, team-coloured, headed by the team logo — that can't overflow
  no matter how many types were tagged. Ledger/columns render it as a
  per-team strip under each column; bento/bumper as a two-row block
  below the core stats; glass as a full-width band spanning both tiles.

### Added

- **Per-point classification (opt-in scouting tags).** `POST
  /api/v1/game/add-point` now accepts an optional `point_type` (`ace`,
  `kill`, `block`, `opp_error`) and, for opponent errors, an optional
  `error_type` sub-classification (`serve_error`, `attack_error`,
  `reception_error`, `ball_handling`, `net_fault`, `position_fault`,
  `other`) — the latter is rejected (422) unless `point_type ==
  "opp_error"`. Tags ride along in the per-OID audit log `params`, are
  ignored on undo, and are fully optional (omitting them records an
  untyped point exactly as before). Live stats
  (`/api/v1/matches/live/stats`) and the printed match report now expose
  a per-team breakdown of point
  types, with opponent errors further broken down by cause; the report
  block is localized across all six supported locales. The match report
  additionally shows each type as a percentage of the team's points
  (point composition) and an "own errors" card attributing points given
  away to the faulting team (count, cause breakdown, and share of the
  opponent's points).
- **Control-UI point-type picker (opt-in).** Two new Behavior settings
  — "Track point types" and "Detailed opponent errors" (both off by
  default) — gate a score-button picker: with tracking on, tapping a
  team's score opens a quick chooser (ace / kill / block / opponent
  error / quick point), and with detailed errors on, an opponent error
  expands into a cause step (serve / attack / reception / ball-handling
  / net / position / other). The fast tap-to-score flow is unchanged
  when tracking is off. Tagged points show a compact glyph in the
  points-history strip. Picker labels are localized across all six
  locales.
- **Point-type stats on the spectator page and overlay recap.** The
  public `/follow/{id}` spectator page now shows a per-team breakdown
  (aces / kills / blocks / opponent errors) and a "last point" badge
  indicating how the most recent rally was won (including the error
  cause for tagged opponent errors). The set-summary recap overlay (the
  ledger, columns, bento, glass and bumper variants) shows the same
  breakdown scoped to the displayed set. All rows are gated to non-empty,
  so a match scored without tags is visually unchanged. The backend now
  ships `point_types_by_set` and `last_point` in
  `/api/v1/matches/live/stats` and the overlay broadcast. New labels are
  localized across all six locales.

### Fixed

- **Type errors surfaced by the wider `mypy` scope (below).** Bringing the
  whole package under the type checker exposed two genuine gaps that the
  old allowlist hid: a return-type widening in ``app/api/match_archive.py``
  (the heterogeneous payload dict widened the inferred return type — the
  ``match_id`` is now a typed local) and three numeric-vs-``None`` typing
  gaps in ``app/match_report.py`` (the streak/rally accumulator dicts and
  ``effective_duration`` now carry explicit annotations). No runtime
  behaviour changes.
- **Keyboard access for the scoreboard wake-handle and serve toggle.** The
  show/hide-controls handle (`ScoreboardView`) and the per-team serve icon
  (`TeamPanel`) were click-only `<div>`/`<span>` elements; they now expose
  `role="button"`, are focusable (`tabIndex`), carry an `aria-label` (and
  `aria-pressed` on the serve toggle), and respond to Enter/Space — so the
  controls are operable without a pointer. Both also gain a
  `:focus-visible` outline so keyboard focus is clearly indicated
  (WCAG 2.4.7).

### Changed

- **Config: the Behavior section was split into focused sections.** The
  single, long "Behavior" settings list is replaced by four top-level
  sections that plug into the existing accordion/sidebar navigation:
  **Display** (auto-hide, auto simple mode), **Statistics** (point-type
  tracking, detailed opponent errors), **Set summary** (recap overlay,
  default style, auto-show timing), and **General** (haptic feedback,
  keyboard shortcuts, language). Every individual setting is unchanged —
  only its grouping moved — so operators can scan and find options more
  easily. New section labels are localized across all six locales.
- **Live-stats are memoized against the audit-log version.**
  ``compute_live_stats`` reads and re-parses the entire per-OID audit log
  and runs ~9 aggregation passes over it. A single scoring action fans
  out to a control-UI state response, an overlay push, and one broadcast
  per connected client — each previously recomputing the identical stats
  from scratch. The result is now cached per OID keyed by a new
  ``action_log.version`` counter (bumped on every append / tombstone /
  clear / delete), so the work runs at most once per audit mutation and
  idle polling (spectator ``/live-stats``, control-UI ``/state``) hits
  the cache for free. No change to the returned values.
- **`mypy` now type-checks the whole `app` package + `main.py`.** Coverage
  was previously maintained as an explicit module-by-module allowlist;
  with the backend fully clean it is checked wholesale so new modules can
  no longer escape the gate silently. The conditional ``prometheus_client``
  import shim in ``app/metrics.py`` now carries explicit
  ``# type: ignore[…, unused-ignore]`` codes so it passes whether or not
  ``prometheus_client`` (and its real type stubs) is installed — CI has it,
  the pre-commit hook env does not.
- **Pinned `ruff` and `mypy` in CI to match the pre-commit hooks.** CI
  previously installed the floating "latest" of each while
  ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` pinned much older versions, so local
  pre-commit and CI could disagree (the root cause of the type-check
  drift above). Both now run `ruff==0.15.8` / `mypy==1.19.1`; bumping
  them is a deliberate change that should land in its own PR.

### Documentation

- Corrected stale paths in ``AGENTS.md``: ``app/overlay_backends`` and
  ``app/api/routes`` are packages (directories), not single modules.
- Added a README screenshot (`docs/screenshots/11-point-type-picker.png`)
  of the opt-in per-point classification picker open over the
  scoreboard, plus a capture step for it in `scripts/screenshots/`. The
  capture pipeline now honours an optional `SCREENSHOT_CHROMIUM_PATH`
  to use a pre-provisioned Chromium where the managed-browser download
  is blocked.

## [5.4.4] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Auto-trigger set-summary recap on set end.** New operator opt-in in
  the Behavior section: when a set closes, the recap overlay appears
  automatically after a configurable delay (default 5 s, range 0–30) so
  the broadcast camera can linger on the players' reaction before the
  overlay covers them, then auto-dismisses after a configurable duration
  (default 15 s, range 5–60). The dismiss yields to live play
  immediately if a point lands in the next set, and the show is
  suppressed entirely if a point lands during the pre-show delay (the
  rally already resumed). Undoing the set-winning point clears any
  pending timers and force-hides the recap. End-of-match transitions
  show the recap but skip the auto-dismiss so the operator clears the
  final recap on their own.
- **Configurable abandoned-match prompt threshold.** The 1-hour
  stale-set detection that surfaces the "match looks abandoned" dialog
  on control-UI load is now configurable via the
  ``STALE_SET_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`` environment variable (default
  ``60``). Set it to ``0`` to disable the prompt entirely — long
  all-day tournaments can opt out without losing the dialog for
  shorter recreational matches. The frontend reads the value from
  ``GET /api/v1/app-config`` on boot, so changing the env var only
  needs a container restart (no client refresh required after that).

### Fixed

- **Per-set timeout history (closes the previous undo-across-set-
  boundaries limitation).** Timeouts used to live in a single per-team
  counter that was zeroed on every forward set transition, so undoing
  a set-winning point couldn't restore the prior set's timeout state.
  Storage now keeps a per-(team, set) array; ``State.get_timeout`` /
  ``set_timeout`` gain an optional ``set_num`` argument (defaulting to
  the current set, so existing call sites are untouched). ``add_set``
  no longer zeroes the counters — the new set starts at 0 naturally
  because no entry has been written yet, and the previous set's
  history survives. ``TeamState`` gains a ``timeouts_by_set`` field
  (current-set ``timeouts`` is preserved for backwards compatibility).
  Legacy state files using only the flat ``Team N Timeouts`` key load
  transparently: the legacy value lands in the current set's slot, and
  the next save writes the new per-set keys alongside.

### Dependencies

- Bump ``starlette`` from ``1.0.0`` to ``1.0.1`` to clear
  ``PYSEC-2026-161``. The runtime ``requirements.lock`` was also
  re-synced with the ``requirements.txt`` drift left over from
  v5.4.3 — ``uvicorn`` ``0.46.0`` → ``0.47.0`` and ``requests``
  ``2.33.1`` → ``2.34.2`` (both already advertised in the v5.4.3
  changelog as ``requirements.txt`` floor bumps; only the lockfile
  pins were stale).

## [5.4.3] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Set-summary overlay follows the operator's UI language live.** The
  OBS browser-source URL is fixed in the streaming app, so the
  ``?lang=`` strategy used by the spectator (follow) page cannot
  reach an embedded overlay once OBS is configured. The control UI
  now syncs the operator's locale onto the overlay's
  ``raw_remote_customization.locale`` whenever it changes, and
  ``set_summary.js`` re-reads ``window.OVERLAY_LOCALE`` on each
  WebSocket update — so the recap re-renders in the operator's
  chosen language without touching OBS. ``locale`` is also seeded
  into the served overlay HTML so the first render boots in the
  right language before any WS message arrives.

### Changed

- README badges refreshed (license / CI / Docker / React / TypeScript
  badges added, Python badge bumped to ``3.11+``) and the Prerequisites
  section now states Python 3.11+ explicitly.

### Dependencies

- Backend: ``uvicorn[standard]`` minimum bumped from ``>=0.46.0`` to
  ``>=0.47.0``; ``requests`` pinned from ``2.34.1`` to ``2.34.2``.
- Frontend: ``react-colorful`` from ``5.6.1`` to ``5.7.0``,
  ``@types/react`` from ``19.2.14`` to ``19.2.15``, and
  ``@vitest/coverage-v8`` from ``4.1.6`` to ``4.1.7``.

## [5.4.2] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Unified overlay/API identifier validation in ``app/id_validation.py`` with
  cross-layer matrix tests.
- CI: Prettier format check on the frontend, Docker image build job, and
  shared ``CUSTOMIZATION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`` env knob for backend caches.

### Changed

- Split ``GameService`` broadcast/audit/rapid-pair helpers and the match
  report HTML shell into dedicated modules; ``require_admin`` now lives in
  ``app/auth_utils`` (overlay routes no longer import from admin).
- Frontend: dialog/modal UI extracted to ``AppDialogs.tsx``; locale strings
  moved to ``frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts``.
- Documentation: README/AGENTS/DEVELOPER_GUIDE aligned on bare overlay OIDs,
  lockfile-based installs, and current test counts; AUTHENTICATION.md §9
  documents secure-by-default operator choices.
- Regenerated README screenshots (spectator page, match report, set summary
  overlay, scoreboard phone view) to reflect the spectator/comeback fixes
  below.

### Fixed

- README troubleshooting no longer claims custom overlay IDs must use the
  legacy ``C-`` prefix.
- **Spectator page surfaced in the config Links section.** The follow
  URL was already in the HUD share dialog but missing from the config
  panel's Links list; it now renders alongside the other share links.
- **Spectator share links preserve the operator's locale.** Both the
  HUD share dialog and the config Links section now append
  ``?lang=<active-locale>`` to the follow URL, so a Spanish operator
  sharing the link no longer drops the spectator into English.
- **Comeback stat ends at the tie (spectator + match report).**
  ``perSetStreakAndComeback`` (spectator) and ``_compute_stats``
  (post-match HTML report) both clamp the post-peak deficit at ``0``
  so a team that recovered from ``-5`` to a tie reads as a 5-point
  comeback instead of continuing to count their subsequent lead as
  part of the recovery. Matters most for a losing side that briefly
  took the lead mid-set.
- **Spectator streak/comeback rows show both teams' max.** ``Racha``,
  ``Racha más larga`` and ``Remontada`` now render per-team values
  side by side instead of collapsing to only the leading team's
  number. The longest-streak row is suppressed when it would only
  repeat the same number already shown one row up under ``Racha``.

### Removed

- Unused ``MatchFinishedError`` exception in ``game_service``.

## [5.4.1] - 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **Original overlay — larger score digits.** Bumped the font size of
  the three number cells (current points, sets won, set history) from
  ``18px`` to ``28px`` via a dedicated ``--score-font-size`` CSS
  variable so the score reads clearly on stream. Team name keeps the
  existing ``--font-size``. Cell width nudged from ``40px`` to ``44px``
  to comfortably fit two-digit scores at the new size. The set-history
  GSAP animation in ``overlay_static/js/app.js`` now reads the
  ``--cell-w`` CSS variable from the container instead of a hardcoded
  ``40``, so the grow-in transition stays in sync with whichever
  overlay style is rendering.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Set summary overlay (opt-in).** New operator-toggled overlay that
  replaces the scoreboard between sets with a recap panel — chart of
  the point progression, score, duration and key stats. Six visual
  styles ship as candidates (``brand_ledger``, ``brand_columns``,
  ``bento``, ``glass``, ``podium``, ``bumper``), all fully
  implemented end-to-end (per-variant HTML markup in
  ``overlay_static/js/set_summary.js`` + scoped CSS in
  ``overlay_static/css/set_summary.css``, ported from
  ``docs/mockups/set-summary/*.html``). Two more variants
  (``split_screen`` and ``jumbotron``) were prototyped during the
  cycle and dropped before merge for being visually weaker than
  the rest. The panel renders into a centred 16:9 stage sized to
  roughly two thirds of the viewport height (with equal margins
  above/below) — fully transparent over the live stream so only
  the data regions get ``rgba()`` fills + ``backdrop-filter:
  blur(…)`` and any OBS scene underneath stays legible. Chart-
  based variants generate their SVG polylines from the live
  ``points_by_set`` payload (not hard-coded mockup data). Wired
  end-to-end: new endpoints ``POST /api/v1/display/set-summary
  {,-style}``, payload fields ``match_info.{show_set_summary,
  set_summary_style,summary_set_num}`` picked up by
  ``set_summary.js``, plus a React control button (icon
  ``summarize``), centre-panel "Set summary is live" notice with
  inline style picker, and matching i18n strings in all six
  locales. A WCAG-aware ``resolveTeamColour`` helper falls back to
  a saturated mockup-palette accent when an operator's team
  ``color_primary`` is too close to white, so the variants that
  paint a full coloured panel (glass score tile, podium pillar,
  brand columns) don't render white-on-white. **Off by default**:
  the feature lives behind a ``setSummaryEnabled`` toggle in the
  Behavior config section so existing setups don't get a surprise
  extra button. Mockup gallery for the six styles lives at
  ``docs/mockups/set-summary/index.html``.

- **Set-summary variants now scale with the stage, not the
  viewport.** The 149 ``clamp(min, X vw, max)`` rules across the
  six variant stylesheets had their ``vw``/``vh`` swapped for
  ``cqw``/``cqh`` (with ``container-type: size`` added to the
  ``.ss-stage``) and their pixel minimums halved. With the old
  setup the "ideal" term of ``clamp()`` bottomed out at its pixel
  floor on small viewports, so a 480p preview kept full-HD font
  sizes while the stage itself shrank — team names wrapped onto
  three lines, ledger chips overflowed, scores cramped against
  the column edges. Switching the scaling unit makes the inner
  content track the stage size (which is itself derived from the
  viewport via ``min(95vw, calc(67vh * 16/9))``) so every variant
  preserves its proportions and information density at 480p,
  720p and 1080p alike.
- **Cross-fade between scoreboard and set-summary recap.** The
  scoreboard → recap toggle used to be an instant DOM swap
  (``display: none`` slammed the scoreboard, ``hidden`` attribute
  slammed the recap panel). Both surfaces now animate via a 450ms
  ``opacity`` transition and keep their layout slot at all times,
  so flipping the toggle produces a real cross-fade. The set-
  summary panel manages its own ``opacity`` + ``pointer-events``
  via inline styles so the transition has a guaranteed "from"
  value when the panel is freshly created on the very first
  activation.
- **Quieter INFO log level.** Restructured per-call-site levels so
  ``LOGGING_LEVEL=info`` gives a readable picture of what the
  server is doing without drowning the operator in per-request
  noise. Successful (HTTP 2xx / 3xx) ``uvicorn.access`` records
  are demoted to ``DEBUG`` by the
  ``HealthEndpointFilter`` — only client / server errors surface
  at the default level, but the full access log comes back when
  the operator enables ``DEBUG``. Per-interaction routes (display
  toggles, session-reuse, customization saves, visibility
  changes, per-broadcast 2xx response logs in
  ``Backend.process_response``) and routine WS client/handshake
  events also drop to ``DEBUG``. One-shot lifecycle events
  (server boot, overlay create/delete/copy, theme applied,
  preset created/deleted, WS heartbeat startup, WS zombie
  eviction, session expiry, ``WSControlClient`` start/stop)
  stay at ``INFO``.
- **"Match looks abandoned" prompt on control-UI load.** When the
  operator opens the React control UI on a session whose current
  set has been live for more than an hour, a confirm dialog now
  surfaces asking whether to reset the match (the scoreboard
  was probably left running by mistake) or keep going. Fires
  once per page load — refusing it doesn't re-trigger on the
  next WS broadcast. Backed by a new ``current_set_started_at``
  timestamp on ``GameStateResponse``, derived from the first
  scoring event of the operator's current set.

### Removed

- **Live-stats panel and points-history strip dropped from the
  in-broadcast overlay.** The two opt-in widgets used to sit on
  top of the live scoreboard in the OBS browser source. Their
  config toggles had already been removed from the operator UI,
  and stale ``show_stats`` flags persisted on existing overlays
  would still surface the panel — which on every non-``original``
  variant rendered as raw black text in the top-left corner
  because each variant's CSS (``pill.css``, ``ribbon.css``, …)
  never carried the rules for ``.live-stats-panel`` or
  ``.points-history-strip``. The elements are gone from
  ``overlay_templates/base.html`` so the live broadcast shows
  only the scoreboard (or the set-summary recap when activated).
  The same stats keep flowing in ``overlay_control.stats`` for
  the spectator (``/follow/{id}``) page and the set-summary
  recap, both of which already render them through their own
  markup.

### Dependencies

- Bump `vite` from 6.4.2 to 8.0.13 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` from
  4.7.0 to 6.0.2 in `frontend/`. The two upgrades are coupled because
  `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` requires `vite@^8` as a peer, so neither
  Dependabot PR (`#319`, `#320`) could land alone — they must ship
  together. `vite-plugin-pwa@1.3.0` and `vite-plugin-compression2@2.5.3`
  already advertise vite 8 compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Set summary clock now ticks every second on a live set.** The
  server-computed ``set_durations`` only refreshes when a new
  audit event lands (each point triggers a broadcast), so the
  duration shown in the recap panel used to visibly freeze
  between rallies. ``set_summary.js`` now anchors a client-side
  ``setInterval`` to the first scoring event's timestamp and
  updates every node tagged with ``data-live-duration`` once per
  second. The tick stays disabled when the displayed set has
  already finished (recap shown during a set break or after match
  end), so the rendered total never climbs past the real set
  length.
- **Set summary recap no longer pins to an unplayed set after
  historical edits.** When the operator backfills earlier sets via
  ``set_score`` after advancing the match, those audit records get
  tagged with ``result.current_set`` and a running score of ``[0,
  0]`` for the active set. Both the resolver
  (``GameService._resolve_summary_set`` / the backend broadcast)
  and the overlay's ledger renderer now ignore ``set_score`` events
  when deciding "did this set actually see a rally?" — so the
  recap rolls back to the previously played set, and the in-set
  ledger no longer renders ghost ``0`` chips.
- **Team-coloured icons stay readable on the panel surface.** The
  timeout dots, timeout button, serve icon, and points-history
  marker in the React control UI now run their colours through a
  WCAG-aware helper that lifts (or lowers) the HSL lightness only
  when the contrast against the current ``--surface`` falls below
  the threshold (4.5:1 for text/icons, 3:1 for UI shapes). The
  hue and saturation are preserved so the two teams remain
  visually distinct, and the helper re-evaluates automatically on
  light/dark theme toggles. The default indigo accent
  (``#5c6bc0``) — which only reached 3.27:1 against the dark
  navy panel — is now lifted to a tone that clears 4.5:1 on dark
  mode while staying recognisably indigo.
- **Match timer no longer ticks past match end.** The HUD timer in
  the React control UI and the match/set counters on the
  `/follow/{id}` spectator page now freeze at the actual end-of-
  match value as soon as the set-winning point or set lands,
  instead of continuing to count up until the operator reloads.
  Backed by a new ``match_finished_at`` timestamp on
  ``GameStateResponse`` and on the overlay broadcast payload's
  ``match_info`` block.
- **Spectator page now shows a "match finished" indicator.** Once
  the match transitions to finished, the alerts strip renders a
  localized ``Match finished`` / ``Partido finalizado`` badge and
  hides the now-stale set-point / match-point / side-switch pills.
  The match/set timer pill also tints green to make the frozen
  state visually distinct from a paused-between-rallies live
  match.
- **Reset on the operator UI now clears the spectator's stats and
  time history.** The overlay state-store deep-merge previously
  left per-set entries in ``overlay_control.points_by_set`` /
  ``timeouts_by_set`` / ``stats.set_durations`` behind because an
  empty dict from the post-reset broadcast is a no-op for a deep
  merge. The store now force-replaces those audit-derived
  subtrees on every update so a Reset wipes the spectator chart,
  history, and per-set durations alongside the scoreboard.
- **Bumper score digits no longer kiss the team-block edges.** The
  oversized scores in the ``bumper`` set-summary variant were
  rendered flush against the home/away team block borders (``align-
  items: flex-start`` / ``flex-end`` with no horizontal padding),
  and the 20px drop-shadow blur on each digit was being clipped by
  the ``.ss-bumper-core`` ``overflow: hidden``. Both digits now sit
  on ``clamp(4px, 1.4cqw, 16px)`` of internal padding, the negative
  letter-spacing was relaxed from ``-0.06em`` to ``-0.04em``, and
  the drop-shadow blur was tightened so the glyphs read fully
  even at 480p.
- **Chart polylines stay distinguishable when both teams share a
  colour.** When the operator picks near-identical primaries (e.g.
  two navy clubs), the home and away polylines used to overlap
  into a single confused trace. A weighted RGB-distance check in
  ``set_summary.js`` now flags ``colorsAreSimilar`` pairs (≈80
  units, captures same-hue/lightness variants) and tags the away
  polyline with a ``ss-line-away--dashed`` class so CSS renders
  it as a dashed stroke — preserving the colour intent while
  keeping the two series readable.
- **"Final" pill no longer lies when the recap is shown mid-set.**
  The ``glass`` and ``brand_columns`` headers hard-coded a green
  "Set N · Final" pill regardless of whether the displayed set had
  actually concluded. Now ``deriveViewModel`` exposes a
  ``setFinished`` flag (true only when the team's ``set_history``
  has a final score recorded for that set) and the renderers swap
  to an amber ``Set N · Live`` pill with a pulsing indicator when
  the set is still in play. Green/Final stays for sets the backend
  has actually closed.

### Changed

- **``match_started_at`` is no longer cleared when a match is
  archived.** The session keeps the start anchor in place after
  match end so the HUD timer and the spectator page can render the
  final elapsed duration (``match_finished_at - match_started_at``)
  until the operator hits Reset — which is now the only path that
  returns the session to the pre-match idle state.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Live stats + points-history in the overlay WebSocket broadcast.**
  Every overlay state push now carries a stats summary (current
  streak, longest streak, partial comeback, total points) and a
  30-point trajectory in `overlay_control.stats` and
  `overlay_control.points_history`. The two per-overlay Config-panel
  toggles ("Show live stats" / "Show points history") gate whether
  the OBS overlay app.js *renders* the panels (default OFF so
  existing overlays look unchanged after upgrade); the data itself
  is always present so the `/follow/{id}` spectator page and other
  consumers can read it regardless of operator display preferences.
  The data is computed from the per-OID audit log via the new
  `app.api.live_stats.compute_live_stats` helper, so the live
  numbers reconcile with the printed match report — no second
  source of truth to drift.
- **`GET /api/v1/matches/live/stats?oid=X&limit=N` endpoint.**
  Returns the same stats payload powering the overlay panel, plus
  per-set durations and the longest-rally proxy. External
  integrators (coach apps, dashboards, secondary panels) can read
  the live report block without polling the audit log directly.
- **Public spectator page at `/follow/{overlay_id}`.** Mobile-first
  read-only follow view that consumes the same `/ws/{output_key}`
  feed as the OBS templates. Surfaced via the operator's share
  dialog (`/api/v1/links` now returns a ``follow`` URL alongside
  control / overlay / preview) so the operator never has to
  hand-build the URL. Resolves by either the raw overlay id or
  its short output key and is excluded from the PWA
  ``navigateFallback`` denylist so a shared URL hits the backend
  Jinja route instead of the SPA shell. Marked
  ``noindex,nofollow`` so the page doesn't leak into search
  engines.
  - **Serve indicator** is an absolutely-positioned pulsing
    volleyball icon docked at the inner edge of the serving
    team's cell (toward the centre divider). Position is fixed,
    so toggling the indicator no longer reflows the layout the
    way the previous under-name badge did.
  - **Set progression chart** has explicit per-team stroke
    colours pulled from the brand palette (no
    ``currentColor`` collapse), a dark plot background
    distinct from the surrounding panel, and dashed grid lines
    with high-contrast tick labels. Up to 5 evenly-spaced Y
    ticks render the running score scale, deduped when the set
    is fresh so the axis never repeats ``0``. The X axis is
    real-time elapsed (``m:ss`` labels at start / mid / end)
    so long sideout streaks and short ace bursts occupy
    visibly different spans. Each scoring event is marked
    with a team-coloured dot; each timeout is a dashed
    vertical line in the calling team's colour with a small
    ``T`` badge at the top.
  - **Scoreboard timeouts indicator.** Two pip dots per
    team next to the sets counter fill in as the operator
    burns timeouts (FIVB max 2/set), so the viewer reads
    available timeouts at a glance.
  - **Serve ball** shrunk so it lives comfortably inside the
    team cell without crowding the score.
  - **Live stats reordered** with total points first, plus a
    new ``Services won`` row showing services-won / served per
    team derived from the audit log's serve transitions.
  - **Set-point / match-point indicator.** A pulsing badge on
    each side of the alert strip flags when the next point
    would close out the set or the entire match. Match point
    takes visual priority over set point on the same side.
  - **Beach side-switch indicator.** A central yellow badge
    counts down points until the next mandatory side switch
    ("Cambio en 2 pts"), flipping to a pulsing
    "Cambiar de campo" the moment the boundary lands. Only
    surfaces for beach mode (indoor uses a client-side
    deciding-set midpoint alert in the operator UI). The
    countdown is driven by ``compute_side_switch`` so it
    matches what the operator sees.
  - **Match-rules quick-reference badge** in the header
    ("Beach · Best of 3 · 21 · 15 in deciding set ·
    Side switch every 7 pts") so a viewer can confirm the
    ruleset without leaving the page.
  - **Scoreboard centre column** now hosts the shared
    indicators (both teams' set wins as a single ``2 – 1``
    pair at the top, with the current ``SET N`` pill pushed
    lower toward the score line). Per-team meta rows dropped
    the redundant "Sets X" label — only the timeouts pips
    remain there — so the central column has visible content
    instead of empty vertical space. The serve indicator
    inside each team cell slid from the column's mid-line
    down to ``top: 64%`` so the volleyball icon lines up with
    the score the viewer is reading rather than floating over
    the team name.
  - **Per-team stats grid.** The stats panel is now a 3-column
    layout (home value · label · away value) instead of single
    rows that mixed team names into the value text. Total
    points are split per team (summed from ``set_history``
    rather than the audit aggregate). Services-won, current
    streak, longest streak and partial comeback render in the
    column of the team they belong to; the opposite column
    shows a muted "—". Rows where neither team has data
    collapse via ``data-empty="true"``.
  - **Chart colour-collision fallback.** When both teams'
    primary colours are within ~60 RGB units the chart's away
    line switches to a high-contrast fallback (mirroring the
    print report's ``_ensure_distinct_chart_colors``) AND
    picks up a dashed stroke pattern, so even pathological
    cases (two reds + a red fallback) still render as two
    distinct traces. The legend swatches mirror the resolved
    colours.
  - **Alert badges use fixed semantic colours.** Set point is
    amber (warning), match point is red with a pulsing glow
    (critical), side-switch is amber (info / pulses when
    pending). Team affiliation is implicit from the alert
    strip's three-column grid (home left, switch centre, away
    right) so the team colour is no longer needed inside the
    badge — matches the React control UI's chip palette.
  - **OID is no longer rendered into the spectator HTML.**
    The page title, footer line and ``window.OVERLAY_TARGET_ID``
    now omit the raw overlay id (it's the secret an operator
    types into the control UI). Only the SHA-derived
    ``output_key`` reaches the browser. The route's
    ``test_follow_*`` regression suite was updated to assert
    this invariant.
  - **Per-set streak, longest streak, and comeback.** The
    stats panel rescopes these to the *viewed* set instead of
    the whole match, computed client-side from
    ``overlay_control.points_by_set`` so the panel
    recomputes when the viewer steps through previous sets.
  - **Page title is i18n'd.** The Jinja template emits a
    neutral English ``<title>`` for crawlers/share previews;
    the spectator JS replaces ``document.title`` with the
    localised version once the language is resolved.
  - **Set + match elapsed counters** in the page header
    (between the rules badge and the connection status) as a
    single inline pill ``MATCH 1:24 · SET 0:32``. Match clock
    ticks live from the new ``match_info.match_started_at``
    field in the broadcast; the set clock derives from the
    viewed set's audit timestamps and adds the wall-clock
    delta when the viewed set is the live one. A 1 Hz
    ``setInterval`` re-renders only the two text nodes so
    the counters move between rallies. Past sets render
    their frozen duration from ``stats.set_durations``.
    Format auto-switches to ``H:MM:SS`` once a counter
    crosses the hour mark; the timer pill reserves enough
    width for that longer string so the layout doesn't
    reflow every second past 60 min.
- **README screenshot for the public spectator page.**
  ``scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs`` now drives a phone-portrait
  full-page capture of ``/follow/{id}`` against the demo overlay,
  written to ``docs/screenshots/09-spectator-page.png`` and embedded
  in the README screenshot grid. The capture pipeline also seeds
  ``volley_gestureTourSeen=true`` via ``context.addInitScript`` so
  the first-use gesture coachmark does not cover the scoreboard /
  config-panel shots after upgrade.

### Changed

- **Backend rules hook is now an explicit setter.** Replaced the
  monkey-patched ``backend._rule_overrides_getter = ...`` from
  ``GameSession.__init__`` with ``Backend.set_rule_overrides_getter``
  so the dependency is part of Backend's public surface. Addresses
  Gemini's coupling concern from the PR review.
- **Defensive ``except Exception`` blocks in
  ``_build_overlay_payload`` and the ``/links`` route now log via
  ``logger.exception`` so the full traceback reaches operator
  logs instead of just the exception's repr.
  - **Backend rules hook.** ``GameSession`` now exposes its
    live mode + per-set limits via a getter the Backend's
    overlay-payload builder consults on every broadcast, so
    the OBS-side WS stream carries the actual session rules
    instead of falling back to env-default ``conf`` values
    (which can diverge after the operator edits rules from
    the React control UI).
  - **Set navigation** lets the viewer step back through past
    sets via prev / next buttons or by clicking any cell in the
    set-history table. The chart freezes on the chosen set
    until the operator advances back to "live"; the active set
    is highlighted in the history table and the header reads
    ``Set N · live`` when tracking the current set.
  - **Per-set data** is now broadcast as
    ``overlay_control.points_by_set`` (full per-set arrays,
    capped at 60 events per set) so the spectator chart can
    render historical sets without a second fetch. The
    existing ``points_history`` (last-30 flat list) is
    preserved for the OBS overlay strip.
  - **Internationalisation:** every string on the spectator
    page is translated for en / es / pt / it / fr / de. The
    page reads the locale from ``?lang=`` first, then
    ``navigator.language``, then falls back to English.
  - The previous bottom "points trajectory" chip strip was
    removed: the set-progression chart covers the same
    information with context (which set, what scale, who's
    leading).
- **Keyboard shortcuts for the operator.** New `useKeyboardShortcuts`
  hook + `ShortcutsHelp` dialog covering the high-frequency
  actions: `A` / `B` add point, `Z` undo, `1` / `2` change serve,
  `Q` / `P` timeout, Space start match, `H` toggle overlay
  visibility, `S` toggle simple mode, `?` open the help cheatsheet.
  Defaults ON for fine-pointer devices (mouse + keyboard), OFF for
  coarse-pointer (touch-only) so the screen keyboard on tablets
  doesn't score phantom points. Toggleable from the Behavior
  section of the Config panel, and disabled while any modal /
  text input owns focus so it never fights the existing dialog
  flow. Translated into the six supported UI languages.

### Changed

- **Recent-actions strip now skips all undo records.** The strip is
  redefined as a pure "current state activity" indicator: it only
  renders chips for actions that still contribute to the live
  score (`point_add`, `set_won`, `match_won`, `timeout`, `manual`).
  Undo records (`point_undo`, `timeout_undo`) and the synthetic
  state-diff undoes (`set_undo`, `match_undo`) no longer surface,
  because the matching forward chip was tombstoned by
  `pop_last_forward` and a floating struck chip has no visible
  counterpart to invalidate. Operators can still consult the
  history drawer and the printable `/match/{id}/report` for the
  full forensic timeline, which keep showing undone actions as
  struck rows. As a consequence: clicking team A, then team B,
  then double-tap-undo on team A (>5 s after the click) now leaves
  the strip showing only `[+1 B]` — no orphan `-1` chip.
- **Internal cleanup.** Removed unused legacy `Backend` pass-through
  methods and the unreferenced `PasswordAuthenticator.compose_output`
  helper. Consolidated four duplicated truthy-env parsers into
  `EnvVarsManager.get_bool_env` / `is_truthy`, and the
  `_data_dir`/`_hashed_basename`/atomic-JSON-write idioms scattered
  across `app/api/*` + `app/overlay/state_store.py` into a new
  `app/api/_persistence_paths.py`. Auth helpers in `app/auth_utils.py`
  now expose shared `extract_bearer_token` and
  `get_hashed_or_plaintext_env` helpers used by the admin and
  overlay-server credential paths. No observable behavior change;
  full `pytest` (1019), `ruff`, `mypy`, and `vitest` (415) suites
  remain green.
- **Recent-actions strip rewritten as a pure projection of the
  tombstone-filtered audit log.** Dropped the `priorEventsRef`
  stickiness buffer in `useRecentEvents` and the
  `INVERSE_UNDO_KIND` suppression heuristic that went with it.
  Every fetch now fully replaces the chip list, so rapid-pair
  collapses (forward + undo within 5 s ⇒ audit empty), generic
  undoes, and resets all converge to the same view the history
  drawer and printable report render. Side-effects of the rewrite:
  * Rapid-pair Case A no longer leaves a ghost "alive" chip in
    the strip after the pair is collapsed at the audit level.
  * Chronological ordering is guaranteed by audit `ts` (server
    monotonic per-OID); the synthetic state-diff set/match-undo
    chips are anchored above the last audit chip, so they always
    render rightmost.
  * The strip no longer recovers chips that age out of the audit
    fetch window — but at `max(40, max*3) = 40` fetched and the
    strip capped at `max = 8` visible, aging out would require
    >32 intervening chips, which doesn't happen in practice.

### Fixed

- **Undo button no longer lags one action behind.** The
  `ActionResponse.state.can_undo` flag that the WebSocket broadcast
  and the HTTP reply carry now reflects the *post-action*
  `undoable_forward_count` for `add_point`, `add_set`,
  `add_timeout`, and `reset`. Previously `state_response` was
  captured before `_audit` bumped the counter, so the very first
  forward action broadcast `can_undo=false` (the undo button stayed
  disabled until the second action), and the final undo back to
  zero broadcast a misleadingly enabled button. The state response
  is now computed *after* the audit append in all four paths.
- **Recent-actions strip clears on match reset even when scores
  stayed at zero.** `scoringKey` in `useRecentEvents` now includes
  `match_started_at`, so a reset that lands on already-zero scores
  (typical after an operator undid everything back to 0:0) still
  refires the audit fetch, triggers the `matchBoundary` cleanup of
  `priorEventsRef`, and lets the empty audit log surface an empty
  strip. Previously the leftover undo chips lingered until the next
  scoring event changed the numeric portion of the key.
- **Recent-actions strip now drops the "alive" chip on undo** so it
  matches how history (`RecentAuditDrawer`) and the printable
  `/match/{id}/report` render the same event. Previously, when the
  preview was hidden and the operator undid an action, the strip
  surfaced both the original chip *and* the struck/undone chip side
  by side, even though the audit-backed views only show the undone
  entry once `pop_last_forward` tombstones the forward record. The
  classifier no longer synthesizes a forward `timeout` chip from
  the post-state diff for popped records, and the recovery buffer
  in `useRecentEvents` now suppresses any prior chip whose undo
  counterpart (point/timeout/set/match) is present in the fresh
  fetch or the snapshot diff.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **Cross-navigation between Config and `/manage`.** The config
  panel's top bar now shows a `dashboard` button on the right
  (mirroring the back-arrow on the left) that links to `/manage`,
  and the Custom Overlay Manager header gains a back-arrow on the
  left of its title that returns the operator to the scoreboard.
  Both surfaces previously required typing the URL by hand.
- **Rapid-pair undo correction (5 s window).** Two opposite
  ``add_point`` actions on the same team within
  ``RAPID_PAIR_WINDOW_S`` (5 s) now collapse to a no-op at the
  audit-log level — neither half surfaces in the report, the
  post-match drawer, or the live history strip. Both directions
  are handled:

  * **Case A** — tap to score, then double-tap-undo within 5 s:
    the just-added forward is tombstoned and no undo record is
    appended. Net audit: nothing for the pair.
  * **Case B** — double-tap-undo, then tap within 5 s: the
    fresh undo record is tombstoned and the forward the undo
    had originally hidden is **restored from its tombstone** via
    a new ``_restore`` audit marker so the timeline keeps the
    original ts. Net audit: as if neither the undo nor the
    recovery happened.

  Outside the 5 s window the actions remain separate (legacy
  unified-undo flow). On a different team the cache stays per-
  team so a deliberate forward on team 2 can't accidentally
  pair with a stray double-tap on team 1. Any non-``add_point``
  mutation (``add_set``, ``add_timeout``, ``change_serve``,
  ``set_score``, ``set_sets_value``, ``reset``) invalidates the
  cache so a follow-up tap can never trigger a false-positive
  recovery. State-level effects (set-end / match-end / serve-
  change webhooks) still fire on the recovery side — the
  underlying state transition really happened (the operator
  briefly closed the set, then reopened it).

  Implementation:

  * New ``RAPID_PAIR_WINDOW_S = 5.0`` module constant on
    ``app/api/game_service.py``.
  * New ``GameSession.rapid_pair_cache: dict[int, dict]`` —
    per-team trace of the most recent ``add_point`` (kind, ts,
    audit_ts, optional popped_ref_ts) used to detect the pair
    on the next call.
  * New ``action_log.tombstone_ts`` and
    ``action_log.restore_popped`` helpers plus
    ``_RESTORE_TOMBSTONE_ACTION = "_restore"``.
    ``_apply_tombstones`` now processes ``_pop`` and ``_restore``
    together so a restore cancels an earlier pop with the same
    ``ref_ts``. ``action_log.append`` returns the written record
    so the caller can capture its assigned ``ts`` for the cache.
  * ``GameService.add_point`` consults
    ``_consume_rapid_pair`` before the normal pop / state-mutate
    / audit-append cycle. On a rapid hit the audit half is
    handled by the cache (no ``_audit`` call); on a miss the
    seed is refreshed via ``_record_rapid_pair_seed``.

  Tests: 11 new in ``tests/test_rapid_pair_undo.py`` covering
  Case A collapse, Case B recovery (with mocked time so the
  prior forwards lie outside the window), different-team
  isolation, every cache invalidation path, and a set-winning
  recovery that re-advances ``current_set``. Pre-existing
  legacy-unified-undo tests (``tests/test_undo_stack.py``,
  ``tests/test_action_log.py``, ``tests/test_undo_unification
  .py``) were updated to mock time past the rapid-pair window
  so they continue exercising the legacy path. Full backend
  suite: 1021 passed (was 1009 + 12 new).

### Changed

- **Unified preset picker — env-driven themes now live alongside
  user-saved presets.** ``APP_THEMES`` entries used to surface as
  a separate "Preloaded Config" dropdown inside the Overlay
  section; user-saved presets lived in their own Presets section.
  Both selectors did exactly the same thing on click — shallow-
  merge the chosen patch into the in-memory edit model and wait
  for the operator to hit Save — but they looked and were located
  differently, so operators had to remember which selector held
  what. ``GET /api/v1/customization/presets`` now returns both
  sources in a single list, with a new ``source: "user" |
  "system"`` field on each ``PresetSummary``. System entries are
  derived from ``APP_THEMES`` at request time, are sorted first
  in the picker, render with a "System" badge, and have no
  delete button. The ``DELETE`` endpoint rejects any slug
  starting with the reserved ``system-`` prefix with a 403, and
  ``presets_store.slugify`` refuses to derive a user slug that
  collides with that prefix. The picker's action button is
  renamed from "Apply" to "Load" (and its translations: Cargar,
  Carregar, Carica, Charger, Laden) to reflect that the click
  stages the configuration without persisting — the existing
  Save button at the bottom of the panel is what writes to the
  backend. The redundant "Preloaded Config" dropdown and the
  ``overlay.preloadedConfigLabel`` / ``overlay.selectAndLoad``
  i18n strings are gone.

- **Match report comeback highlight split into "set-winning" and
  "partial" cards with new thresholds.** Used to: a single
  "Biggest comeback" card surfaced any deficit ≥ 2 pts erased by
  the eventual set winner — so a team that briefly trailed 0-2
  before cruising to 25-10 was still credited with a "comeback".
  Now:

  * **Biggest set-winning comeback** renders only when the erased
    deficit is **5 pts or more**, suppressing the trivial 2-4
    point swings that aren't really comebacks.
  * **Biggest partial comeback** is a new card that surfaces the
    largest deficit *reduction* (peak deficit minus the smallest
    subsequent deficit) achieved by a team that ultimately *lost*
    the set — useful for spotting near-comebacks. Threshold
    `> 3 pts` so a one-rally swing doesn't qualify.
  * When team 1 and team 2 share the same maximum on either card
    the value collapses to the magnitude alone and the per-team
    detail is replaced by "Tied between both teams" rather than
    arbitrarily picking one side.

  ``_compute_stats`` now returns ``set_win_comeback`` and
  ``partial_comeback`` per-team dicts (replacing the old
  single-team ``biggest_comeback``); ``_render_highlights``
  combines them with the new tie-detection logic. New i18n keys
  ``highlightPartialComeback``, ``partialDeltaValue`` and
  ``comebackTie`` across all six locales (en/es/pt/it/fr/de),
  and ``highlightComeback`` rewords to "set-winning". Pinned by
  six new tests in ``TestMatchReportComebacks`` covering the
  per-card threshold, the team-credited side, and both tie paths.

- **Match report timeline drops both halves of every ``undo``
  pair.** Used to: undo records were rendered as a struck-through
  line carrying an "↶ Undone" badge — visible but visually noisy.
  Now: ``_collapse_undos`` removes both the forward action and
  its undo so the timeline reads "as if the undone action never
  happened". Live unified-undo logs already had this shape (the
  forward was popped physically, leaving an orphan undo we
  dropped); legacy paired logs now collapse the same way.
  Removed: ``.undone`` / ``.undone-badge`` / ``.chip-undone``
  CSS, the ``undone`` entry in ``_CHIP_CATALOGUE``, the
  ``was_undone`` parameter on ``_chip_classifier``, and the
  ``undo`` / ``undoneBadge`` / ``legendUndone`` i18n keys across
  all six locales. Existing legacy tests
  (``test_undo_collapses_to_strikethrough``,
  ``test_undone_rows_carry_visible_badge``) replaced with
  ``test_undo_pairs_disappear_from_timeline`` and
  ``test_no_undone_artefacts_in_rendered_html`` that pin the new
  invisibility invariant. The frontend live operator drawer
  (``RecentAuditDrawer``) is unchanged: it still surfaces undo
  records as their own rows because that surface is a transcript
  of operator actions, not a final-state report.

- **Match-report set-by-set table grows a "Timeouts (T1/T2)"
  row.** The per-set timeout count was already shown inline as
  ``25 (2)`` next to the score, but the suffix is easy to miss
  on dense matches. The new row sits below "Set durations" and
  spells out both teams' counts side-by-side as ``2/0`` /
  ``0/1`` / ``—``. Reuses the existing ``_timeouts_per_set``
  audit reducer so a coach can scan timeout usage per set
  without trawling the timeline. New i18n key ``timeoutsRow``
  across all six locales (en/es/pt/it/fr/de). Pinned by
  ``test_set_byset_table_has_per_set_timeouts_row`` and the
  existing ``test_set_score_cell_appends_timeout_count`` was
  extended to assert the new row alongside the inline suffix.

  Full suites: backend 1008 passed, frontend 405 passed.

### Removed

- **``GET /api/v1/themes`` is gone.** ``APP_THEMES`` is now
  surfaced exclusively through the unified
  ``GET /api/v1/customization/presets`` endpoint with
  ``source="system"``. The frontend ``api.getThemes()`` helper is
  removed; the env var itself is unchanged. (The unrelated
  ``GET /api/themes`` endpoint that lists overlay-template render
  themes — used by the in-process overlay engine — is unaffected.)

### Fixed

- **Rapid-pair recovery could hide its own restored forward in the
  report.** Two follow-ups to the rapid-pair undo flow shipped in
  the previous release:

  * ``GameService._invalidate_rapid_pair_cache`` is now also called
    by ``set_rules`` and ``start_match`` (the docstring already
    listed ``set_rules``; the implementation in those methods was
    missing). A rule change or an explicit match start now wipes
    any stale per-team rapid-pair seed so a follow-up tap cannot
    trigger a false-positive recovery against an unrelated forward.
  * **Case B recovery** now gates ``action_log.restore_popped`` on
    the success of ``action_log.tombstone_ts``. Previously the
    restore ran unconditionally, so a failed undo-tombstone left
    the audit log in a state where the orphan undo was still
    visible alongside the restored forward; ``_collapse_undos`` in
    the match report would then pair the two and hide both,
    defeating the recovery. The counter bump (``undoable_forward_count
    += 1``) follows the same gate, matching Case A's atomicity.

  Three regression tests cover the new behaviour: the cache-
  invalidation parametrize now exercises ``set_rules`` and
  ``start_match``;
  ``test_case_b_skips_restore_when_undo_tombstone_fails`` patches
  ``tombstone_ts`` to fail and asserts ``restore_popped`` is never
  reached; and
  ``test_case_b_skips_restore_when_audit_ts_is_missing`` drops
  the cached ``audit_ts`` and asserts both writes bail out (mirroring
  Case A's ``audit_ts is not None and tombstone_ts(...)`` guard so
  a defective seed cannot recreate the orphan-undo state).

- **Match report rendered "Team 1" / "Team 2" instead of the real
  team names when the OID was UNO-backed.** ``app.match_report
  ._team_name`` only checked the canonical ``Team {n} Name`` key,
  but the rest of the codebase (``Customization.A_TEAM`` /
  ``B_TEAM``) and the overlays.uno cloud customization API both
  round-trip the legacy ``Team {n} Text Name`` alias. Custom
  overlays happened to land on the canonical key because the
  React control UI writes that one, so the bug was invisible in
  custom-overlay coverage. Added the legacy alias to the lookup
  list (and pinned the regression in
  ``test_renders_team_names_from_legacy_text_name_alias``).

- **Match report locale ignored the operator's app language —
  always followed ``Accept-Language``.** Sharing the report from
  a Spanish-set control UI to a browser that advertised English
  rendered in English. Reasonable when the report is a public
  permalink; surprising when the operator was the one shaping
  the link. Added a ``?lang=<code>`` query parameter to
  ``GET /match/{id}/report`` that wins over ``Accept-Language``
  when the value is one of the supported locales (en/es/pt/it/
  fr/de). Unknown ``?lang=xx`` values fall through to
  ``Accept-Language`` so the cap can't lock the report into the
  default. ``LinksSection`` in the React control panel appends
  ``?lang=<active-locale>`` to the ``latest_match_report`` and
  ``match_history`` URLs before display / copy; control /
  overlay / preview URLs are passed through unchanged. New
  helper ``frontend/src/components/config/LinksSection.tsx``
  ``withLang`` + a five-case ``LinksSection.test.tsx`` plus two
  backend regression cases (``test_lang_query_overrides_accept
  _language``, ``test_lang_query_falls_back_to_accept_language
  _when_unknown``).

### Added

- **Screen Wake Lock during a live match.** New
  ``frontend/src/hooks/useScreenWakeLock.ts`` holds a screen wake
  lock while ``state.match_started_at != null && !state
  .match_finished`` so the operator's phone doesn't dim or lock
  between rallies. Released deliberately on match end / reset
  and on unmount; transient releases driven by the platform
  (tab hidden, lock screen) re-acquire automatically when the
  page becomes visible again. Silent no-op on runtimes without
  ``navigator.wakeLock`` (desktop browsers, iOS Safari pre-16.4).
  Wired in ``App.tsx`` immediately after ``useMatchAlertHaptics``.
  Tests: ``useScreenWakeLock.test.tsx`` (8 cases: enable / disable
  / unmount / visibility round-trip / unsupported / permission
  rejection / hidden-on-mount / re-acquire).

- **UX Phase 4.2 — recent-audit drawer accessible from the
  scoreboard.** The per-OID action log was previously only
  reachable via the post-match HTML report; during a live match the
  operator had to detour through the config tab or wait for the
  match to finish to confirm "did I undo the right point?" /
  "when was that timeout?". A new ``RecentAuditDrawer`` slides in
  from the right (tablet/desktop) or up from the bottom (mobile)
  on demand, lists the latest 20 records, and stays in sync with
  state confirmations via the existing ``confirmedState`` channel
  from ``useGameState``. Intentionally **not** a modal — the
  team panels behind the drawer remain interactive so the operator
  can keep scoring while reading the drawer. Dismiss via the
  close button, ESC, or tapping the transparent backdrop. Honours
  ``prefers-reduced-motion``.

  * **`useAuditLog` hook.** New
    ``frontend/src/hooks/useAuditLog.ts`` lazily fetches
    ``GET /api/v1/audit?oid=…&limit=20`` when the drawer opens,
    refetches when the trigger key (sums of points + sets +
    timeouts + match-finished) changes, surfaces records
    newest-first. Cancels in-flight requests on OID change /
    drawer close.
  * **`ActionChip` primitive + shared catalogue.** New
    ``frontend/src/components/ActionChip.tsx`` paired with
    ``frontend/src/utils/chipCatalogue.ts``. The TS catalogue
    mirrors the Python ``_CHIP_CATALOGUE`` in
    ``app/match_report.py`` so the live operator drawer and the
    post-match HTML report share the same per-action palette
    (point-t1 / point-t2 / set / timeout / serve / edit / reset /
    undone). Both surfaces use the same glyphs and colours;
    drift between them is now a single-file change instead of
    two.
  * **HUD share cluster grows a history button.** New
    ``history`` icon (deep-purple-300) sits next to the share
    button. Theme constant ``HISTORY_COLOR`` exported alongside
    ``SHARE_COLOR``.

  i18n: 22 new frontend keys (``history.title``, ``history.close``,
  ``history.refresh``, ``history.empty``, ``history.loading``,
  ``history.relative.{justNow,seconds,minutes,hours}``,
  ``history.action.{point,set,timeout,serve,edit,reset,unknown
  ,undoSuffix}``, ``history.legend.{pointT1,pointT2,set,timeout
  ,serve,edit,reset,undone}``) translated across all six
  supported locales (en/es/pt/it/fr/de).

  Tests: ``ActionChip.test.tsx`` (7 cases),
  ``useAuditLog.test.tsx`` (7 cases),
  ``RecentAuditDrawer.test.tsx`` (6 cases),
  ``ControlButtons.test.tsx`` gains a history-button case. Full
  suites: backend 1004 passed, frontend 390 passed.

- **UX Phase 3 — broadcast-side visual hierarchy.** Closes the
  perceptual gap between the operator's "I just won this set"
  feeling and the spectator-facing match report and OBS overlays.
  Set-point and match-point glows on overlays were intentionally
  deferred — they need the points-to-win threshold which the
  overlay state does not currently carry, so a backend-side
  ``match_info.alert`` flag is the next step.

  * **Match-report timeline — typed chips per action.** Each
    ``<li>`` in ``app/match_report.py``'s timeline now carries a
    per-action chip modifier (``chip-point-t1`` /
    ``chip-point-t2`` / ``chip-set`` / ``chip-timeout`` /
    ``chip-serve`` / ``chip-edit`` / ``chip-reset`` /
    ``chip-undone``) plus a glyph cell on the left-hand accent
    strip. Replaces the previously flat ``<ol>`` rendering that
    treated every action identically. Glyphs stay ASCII / single
    emoji so the print stylesheet doesn't depend on an icon font.
  * **Mini legend at the bottom of the timeline.** Decodes the
    chip palette without forcing the spectator to dig through
    docs, with seven entries — points (per team), set, timeout,
    serve change, manual edit, undone — translated across the
    six report locales (``legendPointT1``, ``legendPointT2``,
    ``legendSet``, ``legendTimeout``, ``legendServe``,
    ``legendEdit``, ``legendUndone``).
  * **Enriched footer.** The previously single-line footer now
    spans three lines: existing localized "Generated by…" header,
    a canonical permalink (``/match/{id}/report``) the
    spectator can bookmark, and a "Generated at" timestamp via
    the existing ``_fmt_ts`` helper. New report-i18n keys:
    ``permalinkLabel`` and ``generatedLabel`` across all six
    locales.
  * **Overlay OBS coreography (light).** ``overlay_static/js
    /app.js`` now injects an ``alerts-style`` block into the
    template head on first DOMContentLoaded and dispatches
    transient ``alerts-set-won`` / ``alerts-match-finished``
    glows on team-set increments and rising-edge match
    completion. Match completion is detected from the existing
    ``best_of_sets`` + ``sets_won`` fields the overlay state
    already carries — no backend change required.
    Honours ``prefers-reduced-motion`` (animation disabled) and
    is opt-out via ``state.overlay_control.alerts_visual ===
    false`` for live broadcasts that don't want it.
  * **Unified ``pickAlert`` primitive.** ``MatchAlertIndicator
    .tsx`` now exports the alert resolver and its types
    (``AlertSpec``, ``AlertKind``) so future hooks (sound cues,
    coachmarks targeting alerts, etc.) reuse the same
    transition logic. ``useMatchAlertHaptics`` already does so;
    the export removes the existing private-import smell.

  Tests: 2 new in ``tests/test_match_report.py`` —
  ``test_timeline_emits_typed_chips_per_action`` and
  ``test_footer_carries_permalink_and_generated_at``. The
  existing undo strikethrough cases were retargeted to the new
  composite ``class="timeline-li chip-... undone"`` shape via
  regex matching. Full suites: backend 1004 passed, frontend 367
  passed.

- **UX Phase 2 — discoverability and onboarding.** Surfaces the
  power features that already shipped (gestures, presets, share
  links) so a new operator finds them on the first session instead
  of from the docs.

  * **First-run gesture coachmark.** New
    ``frontend/src/components/GestureCoachmark.tsx`` walks four
    steps — tap to score, double-tap to undo, long-press to edit,
    swipe / gear icon for config — once per browser/profile.
    Persists dismissal via a new ``gestureTourSeen`` setting.
    Keyboard-driven (ArrowLeft / ArrowRight / Enter / Escape) and
    skip / back / next buttons for pointer users. Auto-fires on
    the first authoritative ``state`` arrival; the Behavior config
    section gains a "Replay tour" affordance that flips the flag
    back to ``false`` so the operator can re-watch without
    refreshing. Honours ``prefers-reduced-motion``.
  * **HUD config button gets a discoverability hint.** The
    ``.top-right-config-btn`` now carries a longer ``title``
    ("Configuration — or swipe left") plus an explicit
    ``aria-label`` so screen-reader users hear the canonical
    action while pointer users learn about the gesture, and a
    ``focus-visible`` outline so keyboard navigation never lands
    on it invisibly.
  * **Share button in the HUD.** New cyan share button next to
    Undo opens the existing ``LinksDialog`` (control / overlay /
    preview links with copy buttons) without requiring the
    operator to detour through the configuration panel.
    ``api.getLinks`` is fetched lazily on first open and cached
    for the session.
  * **Active preset hint pill in `/manage`.** The drawer now
    surfaces a "Last applied: <slug>" pill when the operator has
    applied a preset to the overlay in this browser. Storage is
    intentionally client-side (``localStorage`` keyed by OID,
    cleared on overlay delete) — the backend doesn't currently
    pin a "last applied" marker on overlay state, so this is a
    per-browser memory aid rather than authoritative state. A ``×``
    affordance in the pill clears the memory.

  i18n: 17 new frontend keys (``tour.*`` × 12, ``share.title``,
  ``ctrl.configHint``, ``behavior.replayTour``, ``behavior
  .replayTourAction``) plus an extended ``ctrl.configHint``,
  translated across all six supported locales (en/es/pt/it/fr/de).

  Tests: ``GestureCoachmark.test.tsx`` (8 cases),
  ``ControlButtons`` gains a share-button case, ``test_admin
  .test_manage_page_served`` updated to allow client-side opaque
  ``localStorage.setItem`` calls (preset-pill memory) while
  keeping the password-leak guard expressed by name. Full suites:
  backend 1002 passed, frontend 367 passed.

- **UX Phase 0 — quick wins across the four operator surfaces.** Five
  small, low-risk fixes that close visible gaps in the control UI,
  the ``/manage`` admin page, the public match report and the
  preview iframe. Each is independently revertable.

  * **Realtime sync indicator (``ConnectionStatus``).** New pinned
    pill at the top-left of the control UI that surfaces an amber
    "Reconnecting…" badge whenever the WebSocket from
    ``hooks/useGameState.ts`` drops for more than 1.5 s
    (``graceMs`` configurable). Healthy connections render no
    visible chrome — only an off-screen ``role="status"`` /
    ``aria-live="polite"`` element so assistive tech still picks
    up the transition. Honours ``prefers-reduced-motion``.
  * **Stylised confirm dialogs (``ConfirmDialog``).** Replaces
    ``window.confirm`` in App reset and ConfigPanel logout with a
    focus-trapped modal layered on the existing ``Dialog`` primitive.
    Native confirm broke theme/zoom on mobile and skipped the focus
    trap that the rest of the app already depends on. The unsaved-
    changes ``confirm`` in ConfigPanel stays — its synchronous
    return value is what the popstate handler hangs off, and that
    flow is rebuilt in Phase 4 (history rework, not a Phase 0 swap).
  * **/manage create-overlay name length cap.** ``app/admin/static/
    overlays.html`` now enforces ``maxlength="64"`` on the create
    form's name input plus a JS-side guard for paste paths, with an
    inline help-text update. Pre-empts the table-layout breakage that
    arbitrarily long names produced.
  * **Preview iframe failure fallback.** ``OverlayPreview`` now binds
    ``onLoad`` / ``onError`` and starts a 6 s ``PREVIEW_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS``
    timer per mount. If neither fires, an overlay placeholder
    ("Preview unavailable" + Retry button) covers the iframe so the
    operator can recover without unmounting. Retry busts cache via a
    new ``cacheBust`` token so the second attempt isn't served from
    the still-broken response.
  * **Match-report timeline ↶ Undone badge.** ``app/match_report.py``
    ``_render_li`` now appends a non-strikethrough chip to undone
    rows so the marker survives dense timelines and the print
    stylesheet (where the line-through alone is hard to read).
    Localised in all six report locales as ``undoneBadge``.

  i18n: 5 new keys (``conn.online``, ``conn.reconnecting``,
  ``confirm.title``, ``confirm.confirm``, ``confirm.cancel``,
  ``preview.unavailable``, ``preview.retry``) translated across all
  six frontend locales (en/es/pt/it/fr/de). 1 new backend report key
  (``undoneBadge``) translated across the same six locales.

  Tests: ``ConnectionStatus.test.tsx`` (4 cases), ``ConfirmDialog
  .test.tsx`` (6 cases), 3 new fallback cases in ``OverlayPreview
  .test.tsx``, 1 new ``test_undone_rows_carry_visible_badge`` in
  ``tests/test_match_report.py``. ConfigPanel logout tests rewritten
  to assert against the new ``confirm-dialog-ok`` /
  ``confirm-dialog-cancel`` test ids instead of mocking
  ``window.confirm``. Full suites: backend 1002 passed, frontend
  341 passed.

- **UX Phase 1 — sensory feedback and loading state.** Closes the
  perceptual loop so the operator knows *what just happened*
  without having to watch the scoreboard. Sound cues were
  intentionally deferred to a later phase to keep this PR
  focused on the silent-but-visible failure modes.

  * **`useHaptics` hook + per-event patterns.** New
    ``frontend/src/hooks/useHaptics.ts`` wraps ``navigator.vibrate``
    behind a 50 ms throttle, a settings toggle (``haptics``,
    default ``true``), and a feature detect that no-ops on
    runtimes without the Vibration API (desktop browsers, JSDOM,
    pre-18.4 iOS Safari). Five named patterns: ``tap`` (10 ms),
    ``confirm`` (10-30-10), ``alert`` (15-35-15), ``matchPoint``
    (5-pulse), ``finished`` (40-60-40).
  * **`useMatchAlertHaptics` transition watcher.** Hoisted
    ``pickAlert`` out of ``MatchAlertIndicator`` so the new hook
    in ``frontend/src/hooks/useMatchAlertHaptics.ts`` can subscribe
    to the same set / match / finished transitions the indicator
    pill reads. Re-broadcasts of the same alert kind/team are
    suppressed so a stable WS frame can't replay the cue.
  * **Wired into the existing operator gestures.** Server-side
    LIFO undo (HUD button) and per-team double-tap-undo
    (``handleDoubleTapScore`` / ``handleDoubleTapTimeout``) now
    fire the ``confirm`` pattern; the alert watcher lights up on
    set / match / finished transitions. New
    ``behavior.haptics`` toggle in the Behavior section of the
    config panel, translated across the six supported locales.
  * **`ScoreboardSkeleton` placeholder.** New
    ``frontend/src/components/ScoreboardSkeleton.tsx`` mirrors the
    scoreboard's three-pane layout (team A / centre / team B) so
    the "post-OID, pre-first-WS-frame" gap no longer flashes the
    InitScreen with a prefilled value before swapping to the real
    UI. Reuses the ``config-skeleton-shimmer`` keyframes for
    tonal consistency and honours ``prefers-reduced-motion``. The
    InitScreen path is now reserved for the no-OID and post-error
    cases. Carries the realtime-sync pill in its first frame so
    a slow connect is observable end-to-end.
  * **Persistent save-error banner with Retry.** The old
    transient ``.config-save-error`` banner now exposes a real
    Retry button bound directly to ``handleSave``; pending saves
    surface a ``cloud_upload`` "Saving…" pill next to the Save
    button (``role="status"``, ``aria-live="polite"``). The
    success path still navigates back as before, so happy-path
    behaviour is unchanged. New i18n keys: ``config.saving`` and
    ``config.retry`` across all six locales.
  * **Floating toast in the `/manage` admin page.** The inline
    ``.status`` panel was promoted to a fixed top-right pill with
    icon glyphs from Material Icons (``check_circle`` /
    ``error_outline`` / ``info``), a slide-in transition, and
    ``prefers-reduced-motion`` support. Modal-scoped errors opt
    out via the new ``.status-inline`` modifier so login / create-
    overlay / preset modals keep their existing in-flow panels.
    No JS contract change — ``showStatus`` callers (create,
    delete, bulk-delete, preset save, preset apply) emit toasts
    automatically via the styling switch.

  Tests: ``useHaptics.test.tsx`` (7 cases),
  ``useMatchAlertHaptics.test.tsx`` (5 cases),
  ``ScoreboardSkeleton.test.tsx`` (4 cases), 1 new
  ``surfaces a retryable error banner`` case in
  ``ConfigPanel.test.tsx``. ``App.test.tsx`` updated where the
  seeded-OID path no longer flashes an InitScreen input. Full
  suites: backend 1002 passed, frontend 358 passed.

- **Configuration presets — replaces the originally planned
  Fase 2 (themes editables).** Operators can now save subsets of an
  overlay's current state under a name and reapply them — to the
  same overlay or any other — without going through the legacy
  hardcoded ``PRESET_THEMES`` catalogue. Five scopes shipped:
  * ``team_home`` / ``team_away`` — name, short name, primary /
    secondary colors and logo URL. Live-match keys (``points``,
    ``sets_won``, ``set_history``, ``serving``, ``timeouts_taken``)
    are intentionally excluded so a preset apply can never
    silently rewind a match.
  * ``overlay_layout`` — ``overlay_control.geometry``.
  * ``overlay_colors`` — ``overlay_control.colors`` (set_bg /
    set_text / game_bg / game_text). These keys do reach the
    rendered overlay end-to-end via
    ``overlay_static/js/app.js:123-126`` — apologies for the earlier
    rollout note that flagged them as no-op; the original PR #281
    diagnosis missed the JavaScript layer that consumes them as CSS
    custom properties (``--set-bg`` / ``--game-bg`` / etc.). Twelve
    of the sixteen overlay templates render them.
  * ``overlay_style`` — ``overlay_control.preferredStyle`` (which
    Jinja template is served).

  Storage lives at ``data/presets/preset_<sha20(slug)>.json`` —
  same hex-only-basename pattern as overlay state, so a
  user-supplied name never flows into a filesystem path.
  ``PRESETS_MAX_NAME_LEN`` (default 80) and ``PRESETS_MAX_RECORDS``
  (default 500) cap slug length and catalogue size; both override
  via env. Duplicate slugs collide loudly on create (HTTP 409),
  but on re-import they suffix ``-2``, ``-3``... up to ``-99`` so a
  reimport of the same JSON does not silently overwrite the
  catalogue.

  Seven new admin endpoints under ``/api/v1/admin/presets``:
  ``GET`` (list), ``POST`` (create from a source OID's state),
  ``GET /{slug}`` (full record incl. snapshots), ``DELETE /{slug}``,
  ``POST /{slug}/apply`` (target_oid + optional scope subset),
  ``GET /{slug}/export`` (portable JSON), ``POST /import``
  (round-trips ``export`` + tolerates unknown future scopes).

  All apply paths coalesce: a single ``OverlayStateStore.update_state``
  per request, regardless of how many scopes ride along. Same
  one-write/one-broadcast invariant the M4 PATCH endpoint locked in.

  Manager UI ships two new buttons in the Info drawer ("Save as
  preset…" and "Apply preset…"), each backed by an a11y modal
  reusing the existing focus trap / ESC dismissal / opener-restore
  scaffolding. Save-modal pre-selects ``overlay_layout`` /
  ``overlay_colors`` / ``overlay_style`` (the most common
  "tournament template" combo); apply-modal pre-selects every
  scope the chosen preset carries and greys out the ones it
  doesn't.

  Tests: 38 new in ``tests/test_presets.py`` covering scope
  extract / apply / merge invariants, store CRUD with cap and
  collision suffixing, the seven endpoints and an export →
  import round-trip. ``team_home`` snapshot's no-leak guarantee
  is pinned by name (``test_team_home_excludes_match_state``)
  so a future scope edit cannot regress the live-match
  protection. Full suite: 999 passed (was 961 + 38 new).

### Changed

- **Haptic feedback default flipped to `false`.** A fresh install
  no longer surprises the operator with vibration on the first
  scoring tap; the toggle in BehaviorSection opts in. Existing
  operators with ``volley_haptics: true`` already saved in
  ``localStorage`` keep that — only new sessions land on the new
  default. Test scaffolds in ``useHaptics.test.tsx`` and
  ``useMatchAlertHaptics.test.tsx`` flip the flag on explicitly
  in their ``beforeEach`` so the active-path assertions still
  exercise the vibration code path.

### Removed

- **"Replay tour" button + ``behavior.replayTour`` /
  ``behavior.replayTourAction`` i18n keys.** The Behavior section
  no longer exposes a manual re-arm for the gesture coachmark.
  ``gestureTourSeen`` still gates the first-run trigger and
  persists across sessions; rerunning the tour now requires
  clearing the ``volley_gestureTourSeen`` localStorage entry
  (or installing in a fresh browser profile). Cleaner
  BehaviorSection UI: only autoHide / autoSimple / haptics +
  language live there now.

### Fixed

- **`/metrics` was being shadowed by the SPA catch-all when a
  ``frontend/dist`` was present.** ``include_router(metrics_router)``
  in ``app/bootstrap.py`` ran *after* ``_register_spa(application)``
  so any deployment that ships a built frontend (i.e. production)
  would see the SPA shell ``index.html`` returned for
  ``GET /metrics`` instead of the Prometheus exposition. CI runs
  built without the frontend and never tripped, but local +
  production setups did. Same symptom class as the ``/manage``
  bug fixed in PR #281: server-rendered route mounted after the
  catch-all. Moved the include to ``_register_api_routes`` next
  to admin / match-report so the metrics endpoint is reachable
  before the SPA fallback inspects the path.

### Removed

- **Theme selector pulled from the ``/manage`` detail drawer.**
  Validating against real overlay templates after merge revealed
  the colour keys the dropdown wrote (``set_bg``, ``game_bg``,
  ``set_text``, ``game_text``) are not consumed by **any** Jinja
  template in ``overlay_templates/`` — applying ``dark`` or
  ``light`` produced a silent no-op while ``esports`` /
  ``neo_jersey`` / ``split_jersey`` / ``clear_jersey`` happened to
  work only because they also flip ``preferredStyle``. Rather than
  ship a half-working surface the dropdown was removed; the drawer
  now exposes the live preview iframe and the Live-usage panel
  only, and the per-row button is renamed to **Info** to match
  the inspect-only nature of the panel.

  The backend ``PATCH /api/v1/admin/custom-overlays/{name}``
  endpoint is **kept**: it is still useful for automation
  (especially the ``preferred_style`` field, which does drive the
  template selection at render time and works end-to-end). The
  manager UI just no longer wires a button to it. ``GET
  /api/themes`` and the legacy ``POST /api/theme/{id}/{name}``
  carry on unchanged. A future iteration that genuinely consumes
  the colour keys in the templates can re-introduce the selector
  without further backend changes.

### Fixed

- **PWA service-worker no longer requires a force-reload after a
  release for routes like ``/manage``.** ``frontend/vite.config.js``
  now sets ``workbox.skipWaiting: true`` and
  ``workbox.clientsClaim: true``. The previous default kept the old
  service worker active until every tab closed, so on a fresh deploy
  operators would land on the SPA shell at ``/manage`` (a route that
  is in the ``navigateFallbackDenylist`` of the new SW but was not
  in the old one) until they hit Ctrl+Shift+R. Operators are
  internal users — there's no consumer-side flow that the immediate
  SW takeover would break — so claiming clients on activation is
  the right tradeoff for an admin app. Same SW config also adds
  ``/metrics`` to the ``navigateFallbackDenylist`` so manual
  inspection from a browser with the PWA installed hits the
  Prometheus exposition rather than the SPA shell.

- **Code-review follow-ups on Fase 4 (CR-3, CR-4, M-1).** Three
  issues surfaced in the post-fase code review:
  * **Webhook replay was a self-DoS waiting to happen.**
    ``POST /api/v1/admin/webhooks/replay`` ran synchronously and
    iterated every dead-letter record with up to ~25 s of blocking
    retries each — a fully-loaded DL would pin the handler for
    tens of minutes, well past any sensible HTTP timeout, and tie
    up an entire FastAPI thread. The endpoint now (a) accepts a
    ``max_records`` query param (default 50, cap 500) and replays
    only the oldest-eligible slice, (b) runs the blocking work
    via ``run_in_threadpool`` so the event loop stays free for
    other handlers, and (c) reports ``remaining_in_dl`` so the
    operator can iterate (``while remaining > 0: replay``)
    without guesswork. Records held back by ``since`` /
    ``max_records`` are preserved untouched.
  * **The dead-letter file had no size cap.** A misbehaving
    target during a multi-day outage could grow
    ``data/webhooks_dead_letter.jsonl`` without bound — the same
    anti-pattern Fase 4 just fixed for the audit log. ``append``
    now enforces ``WEBHOOK_DEAD_LETTER_MAX_RECORDS`` (default
    1000) by dropping the oldest entries via an atomic rewrite
    when the cap is breached, so even a runaway producer stays
    inside a bounded disk footprint. A new
    ``voc_webhook_dead_letter_size`` Prometheus gauge tracks the
    current count so dashboards can alert before the cap is
    reached.
  * **Heartbeat tick walked clients serially.** With
    ``WSHUB_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS > 0`` and a busy OID, a
    200-client sweep could take 200 × ``BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT``
    of wall time. ``_heartbeat_tick`` now classifies clients
    once, fans the zombie closes and healthy pings out via
    ``asyncio.gather`` (with ``return_exceptions=True`` so a
    single stuck socket cannot wedge the rest), and applies the
    bookkeeping after the gather lands — so 200 clients finish
    in roughly ``BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT``.
  Tests: 7 new cases — DL ``count``/cap eviction/gauge updates
  in ``tests/test_webhooks.py``, ``max_records`` paginated
  replay + ``remaining_in_dl`` in ``tests/test_admin.py``, and
  the concurrent + mixed-zombie heartbeat sweeps in
  ``tests/test_api_routes.py``. Full suite: 960 passing.

### Added

- **Prometheus ``/metrics`` endpoint + instrumentation
  (Fase 4 / M15).** A new ``app.metrics`` module wires
  ``prometheus_client`` (now in ``requirements.txt``) into the
  hot paths and surfaces the result at ``GET /metrics``. The
  endpoint speaks the standard Prometheus text-exposition format
  (``text/plain; version=0.0.4``) and is mounted at the app
  root rather than under ``/api/v1`` so it lines up with every
  other Prometheus-instrumented service the operator might be
  scraping.

  Metrics emitted:
  * ``voc_http_request_duration_seconds`` — histogram of
    end-to-end HTTP latency, labelled by ``route`` (the FastAPI
    route template — bounded by the OpenAPI surface, not the
    raw path), ``method`` and ``status``. Wired through a new
    ``MetricsMiddleware`` placed inside ``ExceptionLogging``
    but outside ``RequestContext`` so the bucket reflects the
    full handler cost.
  * ``voc_webhook_delivery_total{event, status}`` — counter
    with ``status`` ∈ ``success`` / ``client_error`` /
    ``server_error`` / ``exception`` / ``ssrf_blocked`` /
    ``dead_letter``. ``dead_letter`` is incremented in
    addition to the per-attempt status so an alert can fire on
    "X events landed in the DL" without subtracting other
    buckets.
  * ``voc_ws_clients_total`` — total open frontend WebSocket
    connections across all OIDs (unlabelled).
  * ``voc_ws_oids_active`` — number of distinct OIDs with at
    least one open subscriber (unlabelled).
  * ``voc_active_sessions`` — live ``GameSession`` count
    tracked by ``SessionManager`` (unlabelled).

  The plan called for ``ws_clients_per_oid`` as a labelled
  gauge; that label would be unbounded in OID space (textbook
  Prometheus anti-pattern). The two unlabelled gauges above
  give the operator the same dashboard story (total fan-out
  plus breadth) without the cardinality risk.

  Auth ladder mirrors ``/manage``: by default the endpoint is
  unauthenticated (the exposed values are aggregates, no
  payloads, no per-OID labels — safe to scrape from the cluster
  service mesh). Operators that prefer to gate it set
  ``METRICS_REQUIRE_ADMIN=true``, which checks the same Bearer
  token as ``/api/v1/admin/*``. The auth check fires *before*
  the library-availability check so an unauthenticated probe
  cannot use the 503-vs-200 difference to fingerprint whether
  the metrics backend is loaded.

  Graceful degradation: if ``prometheus_client`` is missing
  (older deploys that have not run ``pip install -r
  requirements.txt``), every helper becomes a no-op, the rest
  of the app boots normally, and ``/metrics`` returns a 503
  with a clear "install prometheus-client" message instead of
  a confusing 404.

  Tests: 7 new in ``tests/test_metrics.py`` covering the
  exposition format + content, the route-template label, the
  default-no-auth path, ``METRICS_REQUIRE_ADMIN`` gate,
  503-when-password-unset, the webhook counter increment, and
  the WS gauges tracking ``WSHub.connect`` / ``disconnect``.
  Suite at 953 passing.

- **Webhook retries + dead-letter queue + operator replay
  (Fase 4 / M16).** The outbound webhook dispatcher used to be
  fire-and-forget: a single 503 from a flaky receiver dropped
  the event on the floor with nothing more than a log warning.
  Three changes:
  * **Retries with exponential backoff.** ``_attempt_with_retries``
    runs the configured ``WEBHOOK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`` (default 3)
    additional POSTs after the first failure, sleeping
    ``WEBHOOK_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS * 2**(attempt-1)`` between them
    (capped at ``WEBHOOK_RETRY_MAX_SECONDS``). Defaults give the
    classic 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 progression. Retries fire on 5xx and
    on ``requests.RequestException`` (timeouts, connect errors);
    **4xx is treated as permanent client rejection** — no retry,
    no dead-letter, just a warning, because retrying a "bad
    request" never converges.
  * **Dead-letter queue.** When retries are exhausted on a
    transient failure, the delivery is appended to
    ``data/webhooks_dead_letter.jsonl`` with the URL, event,
    OID, body (as a UTF-8 string for human inspection), last
    error string and attempt count. The HMAC ``secret`` is
    deliberately **not** persisted — replay re-resolves the
    target's secret from the live config, so rotating
    ``WEBHOOKS_SECRET`` does not strand legacy entries with
    stale signatures and a leaked DL file does not leak signing
    keys. SSRF blocks and 4xx rejections are also kept out of
    the DL because they are not replay-recoverable. The DL file
    is rewritten atomically (tempfile + ``os.replace``) so a
    crash mid-write cannot leave it half-written.
  * **Operator replay endpoint.** New
    ``POST /api/v1/admin/webhooks/replay`` (gated by
    ``OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD``) reads the DL, optionally
    filters by ``since=<unix-seconds>``, redelivers each record
    against the current target config, and rewrites the file
    with only the entries that still failed (plus those whose
    URL no longer matches any configured target — kept so the
    operator can fix the config and retry). The response carries
    counts only (``considered`` / ``succeeded`` /
    ``still_failing`` / ``skipped_unknown_url``); the payloads
    themselves are never echoed through the admin surface.

  Tests: 8 new in ``tests/test_webhooks.py`` (first-attempt
  success, 5xx-then-success, 5xx-exhausts-retries, 4xx-no-retry,
  RequestException retries, ``replay_records`` happy path,
  unknown-URL preservation, attempts-counter increment) plus
  4 endpoint-level cases in ``tests/test_admin.py`` (auth,
  empty-DL no-op, success path pruning, ``since`` filter
  preserving older entries). Suite at 946 passing.

- **WebSocket connection cap + opt-in server heartbeat
  (Fase 4 / M14).** Two complementary defences against runaway
  ``WSHub`` registries:
  * **Connection cap.** ``WSHub.connect`` now refuses upgrades
    when an OID already has ``WSHUB_MAX_CLIENTS_PER_OID`` (default
    200) subscribers. The reject path raises a new
    ``WSHubFull`` exception **before** ``ws.accept()``, and the
    ``/api/v1/ws`` endpoint translates it into a WebSocket close
    with code ``1013`` ("Try Again Later") — the conventional
    server-side back-pressure signal. The cap protects the box
    from a runaway tab loop or a misconfigured load test eating
    file descriptors. Configurable via the
    ``WSHUB_MAX_CLIENTS_PER_OID`` env var.
  * **Server heartbeat (opt-in).** When the operator sets
    ``WSHUB_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS > 0``, a background task
    started from ``router_lifespan`` sweeps every connection
    every ``INTERVAL`` seconds, sends an application-level
    ``{"type":"ping"}`` frame, and evicts any client whose
    ``mark_active`` timestamp is older than
    ``WSHUB_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (default 60 s) with a 1011
    close ("server error") and a clean ``disconnect``. Default
    interval is **0 (disabled)** because the existing browser
    client does not yet ack application-level pings — turning
    this on without first updating the frontend would churn live
    tabs every timeout. A new ``_env_float_nonneg`` helper in
    ``app.constants`` lets ``KEY=0`` survive the validation as a
    genuine "off" signal (the strict ``> 0`` filter on
    ``_env_float`` would otherwise upgrade it to the default).
  Tests: 6 new cases in ``tests/test_api_routes.py`` covering
  ``WSHubFull`` raise-before-accept, the endpoint's 1013 close,
  zombie eviction past the timeout, healthy-client ping
  dispatch, ``mark_active`` bumping ``_last_seen``, and the
  ``start_heartbeat`` no-op path. Suite at 934 passing.

- **Audit log rotation + cursor-based pagination
  (Fase 4 / M13).** The per-OID action audit
  (``data/audit_<hash>.jsonl``) used to grow without bound — a
  long tournament could leave a single file with hundreds of
  thousands of lines, every read of which (``match_archive``,
  ``GET /audit``, undo) walked the whole thing. Two changes:
  * **Logrotate-style rotation.** Once the active file exceeds
    ``AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES`` (default 5 MiB), it rotates to
    ``audit_<hash>.jsonl.1``, bumping older rotations down by one
    suffix; anything past ``AUDIT_LOG_MAX_FILES - 1`` rotated
    slots (default 5 total files counting the active) is dropped.
    Rotation runs inside the existing per-OID lock so concurrent
    appends never see a torn rename. ``read_all`` /
    ``pop_last_forward`` / ``peek_last_forward`` walk the active
    file plus every rotated file in chronological order, so
    ``match_archive`` and the undo path keep seeing the full
    visible history regardless of how many rotations have
    occurred. ``clear`` and ``delete`` now sweep the whole family
    (active + rotated) so a match reset starts genuinely empty.
    Both knobs respect the same env-var override pattern as the
    other tunables in ``app.constants``.
  * **Cursor-based pagination on ``GET /audit``.** New optional
    ``before_ts`` query parameter; the response now carries a
    ``next_cursor`` field that the caller passes back to walk
    history one window at a time. Older calls without
    ``before_ts`` keep returning the most recent ``limit``
    records, so the existing dashboard contract is preserved —
    only new clients pay attention to ``next_cursor``. Tombstones
    are honoured by the cursor so an undo between two pages does
    not leak the cancelled record.
  Tests: ``tests/test_action_log.py`` adds 13 new cases covering
  no-rotation-under-threshold, single-rotation cross-file reads,
  cap eviction (oldest records dropped), ``clear``/``delete``
  sweeping the rotated set, undo tombstones spanning rotation,
  cursor walks across all records, null-cursor on final page,
  and pagination respecting tombstones. Suite at 928 passing.

- **`/manage` — bulk delete, filter and per-overlay detail drawer
  (Fase 1 — frontend half).** Three sizeable additions to the
  custom-overlay manager UI:
  * **Filter input** above the toolbar: live, case-insensitive
    substring match against the overlay's name, OID and output
    key. The result count (`23 of 50`) sits next to the input
    with `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce the
    new total when the operator types.
  * **Bulk delete.** A new "Select" column adds a checkbox per
    row, and a "Select all visible" checkbox in the header. The
    toolbar gains a "Delete `<N>` selected" button (disabled
    when nothing is checked); clicking it reuses the existing
    confirmation modal, which now switches between the original
    1-overlay layout and a list of up to 10 OIDs (with "… and N
    more" tail) for multi-deletes. Deletes run sequentially so a
    401 mid-run bounces back to login instead of fanning out N
    parallel failures, and the status line summarises partial
    successes ("`5 of 8 deleted; stopped at error: …`"). Selections
    that point at OIDs no longer present after a server-side
    refresh are dropped automatically.
  * **Detail drawer.** A new "Edit" button on every row opens a
    right-hand `<aside role="dialog">` that shows: a live
    preview iframe (`/overlay/<output_key>?style=mosaic`,
    `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"`), a theme
    dropdown wired to `GET /api/themes` and the new
    `PATCH /api/v1/admin/custom-overlays/{name}` endpoint, and
    a "Live usage" panel fed by `GET /usage` with a green/grey
    dot ("Live" vs "Idle"), OBS viewer count, scoreboard tab
    count, active-session flag and human-readable
    "last activity 30s ago / 4m ago / 2h ago" string. The drawer
    uses `inert` + `aria-hidden` instead of `display: none` so
    the slide-in transition is meaningful, ESC closes it, and
    focus returns to the originating button. After a theme is
    applied, the iframe `src` is bumped with a cache-busting
    `t=<now>` query so the operator immediately sees the new
    look.

  ⚠️ Screenshot regeneration: the `/manage` page now shows three
  buttons in the toolbar (`+ New overlay`, `Refresh`, `Delete N
  selected`) and a checkbox column. Run
  `bash scripts/screenshots/run.sh` to refresh
  `docs/screenshots/05-manage-page.png`. Skipped in this commit
  because it needs Node + Playwright + a live server.

### Added

- **Admin endpoints for editing and inspecting custom overlays
  (Fase 1 — backend half).** Two new routes under
  ``/api/v1/admin/custom-overlays/{name}``:
  * **``PATCH``** — partial update of a custom overlay's appearance.
    The body accepts any combination of ``theme`` (preset name from
    ``GET /api/themes``), ``colors`` (dict deep-merged into
    ``overlay_control.colors``) and ``preferred_style`` (validated
    against the renderable templates plus ``default``). When both
    ``theme`` and explicit overrides are sent, the theme is applied
    first so user-supplied values win on the second merge — that's
    the operator's mental model. Empty patches are rejected with
    400 to flag accidental form submissions instead of silently
    no-op'ing. The mutation flows through
    ``OverlayStateStore.update_state`` so OBS browser sources
    receive the broadcast in real time (50 ms debounce).
  * **``GET /usage``** — snapshot of how many live consumers a
    custom overlay has: ``obs_clients`` (browser-source viewers),
    ``frontend_ws_clients`` (scoreboard control tabs subscribed via
    ``WSHub``), ``has_active_session`` (live ``GameSession``) and
    ``seconds_since_last_activity`` (clamped at the session TTL).
    The relative duration intentionally avoids confusing
    ``time.monotonic`` timestamps with epoch wall-clock —
    ``GameSession.touch`` uses monotonic and the operator's
    question is "is this still live?", not "when exactly".
  Both routes require ``OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD`` and feed the
  drawer/usage indicator scheduled for the frontend half of Fase 1.

### Refactored

- **``PRESET_THEMES`` extracted to ``app.overlay.themes``.** The
  static catalogue used to live inside ``app/overlay/routes.py``,
  which made it inaccessible to ``app/admin/routes.py`` without a
  circular import (overlay → admin already exists for
  ``require_admin``). Moving it to a dedicated module breaks the
  cycle, exposes a stable ``get_theme_names()`` helper to both
  routers, and prepares the seam M8 (Fase 2) will widen when
  themes become directory-backed under ``data/themes/``. The
  ``GET /api/themes`` and ``POST /api/theme/{id}/{name}`` public
  routes are unchanged on the wire — they now read through
  ``themes.PRESET_THEMES`` instead of the local dict.

### Changed

- **`/manage` — auth-error handling unified across every admin call.**
  The custom-overlay manager page previously only bounced the operator
  back to the login view when ``loadOverlays`` got a 401/403; the
  delete and create flows logged the raw error inside the dialog and
  left the now-stale password in memory. A shared ``handleAuthError``
  helper now clears the cached password, dismisses any open modal,
  shows the login view and re-focuses the password input from
  ``loadOverlays``, ``performDelete`` and the ``createForm`` submit
  alike. Symptom: rotating ``OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD`` while a
  manager tab was open used to leave the operator stuck inside a
  half-broken modal until they refreshed.

### Tests

- **Coverage for the new env-var overrides in ``app.constants``.**
  ``tests/test_constants.py`` (14 tests) reloads ``app.constants``
  under each ``monkeypatch.setenv`` and verifies the ``SESSION_TTL_*``
  / ``WS_*_SECONDS`` overrides honour the env, fall back to defaults
  on garbage / empty / non-positive input, and that the legacy
  re-exports in ``app.api.session_manager`` and ``app.ws_client`` see
  the same value after a matching reload. Without these the only
  thing protecting the override contract was the implicit "defaults
  match legacy values" coincidence; a regression in the ``_env_int``
  / ``_env_float`` parsers would have been silent.

### Changed

- **`/manage` quick wins (Fase 0 del roadmap de mejoras).** Three
  small but operator-visible improvements to the custom-overlay
  manager page (`app/admin/static/overlays.html`):
  * **Accessible delete confirmation.** The custom-overlay delete
    flow no longer uses `window.confirm`. It now opens a
    `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"` overlay that shows the
    overlay's name, OID and output key, traps TAB inside the
    dialog, restores focus to the originating button on close, and
    dismisses on ESC. The Cancel button is default-focused so a
    stray ENTER cannot delete by accident. The pre-existing "New
    custom overlay" modal received the same `aria-modal` /
    `aria-labelledby` annotations.
  * **Descriptive ARIA labels on the action buttons.** Screen-reader
    users now hear "Copy overlay `mybroadcast`" / "Delete overlay
    `mybroadcast`" instead of bare "Copy" / "Delete".
  * **Mobile-friendly overlay table.** Below 600 px the overlay
    list collapses into a stacked card layout (each row labelled
    via `data-label` `::before` pseudo-elements), so the manager
    is usable from a phone in a courtside operator workflow.

  No API contract changes; `tests/test_admin.py` keeps passing.

- **Centralised tunable constants in `app.constants`.** The
  hardcoded `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (idle session eviction),
  `WSHub._BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT` (per-socket broadcast timeout)
  and the `WSControlClient` reconnect/heartbeat parameters
  (`_RECONNECT_BASE` / `_RECONNECT_MAX` / `_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` /
  `_ZOMBIE_DEADLINE`) now load from `app.constants` and accept
  env-var overrides (`SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`,
  `WS_BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `WS_RECONNECT_BASE_SECONDS`,
  `WS_RECONNECT_MAX_SECONDS`, `WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
  `WS_ZOMBIE_DEADLINE_SECONDS`). Non-numeric or non-positive values
  fall back to the previous defaults so a misconfigured environment
  degrades gracefully. The legacy module-level names
  (`app.api.session_manager.SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`,
  `app.api.ws_hub.WSHub._BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT`,
  `app.ws_client._ZOMBIE_DEADLINE`…) are preserved as
  re-exports/initialisers so the existing monkeypatch in
  `tests/test_api_routes.py` and the deadline read in
  `tests/test_ws_client.py` keep working untouched.

## [5.1.4] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **OverlayPreview iframe blocked by the strict default CSP (regression
  in v5.1.3).** The new ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware`` shipped a default
  ``Content-Security-Policy`` without a ``frame-src`` directive, so
  browsers fell back to ``default-src 'self'`` and silently blocked
  every cross-origin iframe in the React control UI. Two real-world
  paths broke:
  * UNO overlay previews loaded from ``https://overlays.uno`` (the
    iframe inside ``OverlayPreview.tsx`` for non-custom overlays).
  * Custom-overlay previews when ``OVERLAY_PUBLIC_URL`` points at a
    different host than the control UI itself — e.g. a Traefik
    deployment that serves the scoreboard on ``marcador.example.com``
    and the overlay on ``overlay.example.com``.

  ``_DEFAULT_CSP`` now includes ``frame-src 'self' https:``, which
  unblocks both cases without weakening the policy meaningfully:
  ``data:`` / ``javascript:`` / ``http:`` iframe sources remain
  forbidden, and the iframe content's own origin still governs what
  scripts run inside it (``sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"``
  in ``OverlayPreview.tsx`` is unchanged). Operators that already set
  a custom ``SECURITY_CSP`` should add ``frame-src 'self' https:`` to
  their override string.

## [5.1.3] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- **Type-safer settings persistence.**
  ``frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.tsx::readAll`` no longer needs the
  ``as unknown as Record<string, unknown>`` double-cast to write
  parsed JSON back into the typed ``Settings`` object — it routes
  through ``Object.assign`` instead. The remaining ``as unknown as``
  cast in ``OverlayPreview.tsx`` is now documented inline (it is
  required because Chromium's iframe ``allowTransparency`` honours
  the string form more reliably than the boolean React types model).
- **Centralised TeamState re-imports.** ``TeamState`` now lives in
  ``frontend/src/api/client.ts`` alongside the other generated-schema
  type aliases. The four call sites
  (``useGameState.ts``, ``useRecentEvents.ts``, ``TeamPanel.tsx``,
  ``test/TeamPanel.test.tsx``) import from there instead of digging
  into ``./schema`` directly.
- **Expanded mypy coverage.** ``[tool.mypy] files`` in
  ``pyproject.toml`` grew from 6 to ~17 modules. ``app/state.py``,
  ``app/customization.py``, ``app/game_manager.py``,
  ``app/conf.py``, ``app/oid_utils.py``,
  ``app/env_vars_manager.py``, ``app/app_storage.py``,
  ``app/match_report_i18n.py``, ``app/match_report_signing.py``,
  ``app/password_hash.py``, ``app/auth_utils.py``,
  ``app/security_bootstrap.py``, and
  ``app/overlay/state_store.py`` are now type-checked. The
  expansion required minor cleanups: ``AppStorage`` and
  ``Customization`` static helpers got the ``@staticmethod``
  decorator they were missing, ``State.OIDStatus`` got the right
  enum name, and ``EnvVarsManager._remote_config_cache`` /
  ``Customization.predefined_teams`` /
  ``Customization.THEMES`` got explicit type annotations. No
  runtime behaviour change.
- **Stricter Ruff rule set.** ``pyproject.toml`` now selects ``UP``
  (pyupgrade), ``C90`` (mccabe complexity, capped at 18), ``RUF``,
  and ``SIM`` on top of the previous ``E/F/W/I/B``. The mass
  modernization sweep replaced legacy ``Optional[X]`` /
  ``Dict[X, Y]`` annotations with ``X | None`` / ``dict[X, Y]``,
  upgraded a handful of ``open(...)`` redundant modes, sorted
  ``__all__`` blocks, and dropped now-unused ``typing`` imports.
- **Stricter TypeScript flags.** ``frontend/tsconfig.json`` now
  enables ``noUncheckedIndexedAccess``, ``noUnusedLocals``,
  ``noUnusedParameters``, and ``noImplicitReturns``. Index-access
  callsites in ``useRecentEvents``, ``useSwipeNavigation``,
  ``i18n``, and the ``FONT_SCALES`` lookup in ``App.tsx`` were
  hardened. A new ``DEFAULT_FONT_SCALE`` export in
  ``frontend/src/theme.ts`` provides a fallback that doesn't
  flow through indexed access.

### Fixed

- **Material Icons no longer blocked by CSP.** The control UI used to
  load the icon font from ``https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons``,
  which the security-headers CSP (``style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'``,
  ``font-src 'self' data:``) blocks on fresh page loads — leaving the
  timeout / serve / bottom-bar buttons rendered as text ligatures.
  The font is now bundled with the frontend via the ``material-icons``
  npm package (filled variant only) and served same-origin from
  ``/assets/``, so no third-party network request is made and the
  default CSP is unchanged. Side benefit: the UI now works in
  airgapped / firewalled deployments.
- **Overlay templates' Google Fonts allowed by CSP.** Several overlay
  styles (``clear_jersey``, ``neo_jersey``, ``split_jersey``,
  ``compact``, ``original``, ``esports``, ``glass``, ``mosaic``,
  ``pill``, ``ribbon``, ``shield``, ``vertical``, ``style``,
  ``style_reference``, ``split``, ``diagonal``) load Outfit / Inter /
  Roboto / Oswald / Montserrat / Rajdhani / Barlow Condensed / Chakra
  Petch / Rubik from ``fonts.googleapis.com``. The strict default CSP
  blocked them and OBS browser sources fell back to system sans-serif.
  ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware._build_html_csp`` now appends
  ``https://fonts.googleapis.com`` to ``style-src`` and
  ``https://fonts.gstatic.com`` to ``font-src`` **only on
  ``/overlay/*`` paths** (alongside the existing
  ``frame-ancestors *`` relaxation). The control UI, ``/manage``, and
  ``/match/{id}/report`` keep the strict 'self'-only CSP.
- **Dialog accessibility.** ``SetValueDialog`` and ``LinksDialog``
  now share a new ``frontend/src/components/Dialog.tsx`` primitive
  that renders ``role="dialog" aria-modal="true"``, focuses the
  card on open, listens for the ESC key to dismiss, and replaces
  the previous ``<div onClick>`` backdrop with a real ``<button>``
  so keyboard users can dismiss the dialog without a mouse. CSS is
  unchanged (same ``.dialog-overlay`` / ``.dialog-card`` classes
  plus a new transparent ``.dialog-backdrop`` button) so the
  visual appearance is identical and screenshot regeneration is
  not required.
- **Silent exception swallowing in overlay state I/O.**
  ``OverlayStateStore._read_state_sync``,
  ``save_persisted_state[_async]``, ``_iter_persisted_ids`` and
  ``_migrate_legacy_files_locked`` now narrow their previously
  blanket ``except Exception`` to the specific
  ``OSError | json.JSONDecodeError`` they actually recover from. A
  programming error inside the read path no longer gets logged as
  a warning and masked. Two new tests cover the corrupt-JSON and
  unreadable-file fallback paths.
- **Stale-client drop visibility.**
  ``ObsBroadcastHub._send_to_clients`` now logs the dropped client
  at debug level, and ``WSControlClient.disconnect`` /
  ``WSControlClient._listen`` log close/heartbeat failures so a
  disconnect storm shows up in the log instead of being silently
  swallowed.
- **Lost broadcast tasks.** ``WSHub.broadcast_sync`` and
  ``broadcast_payload_json_sync`` now keep a strong reference to
  the task they create via ``loop.create_task(...)``. Without it
  the asyncio loop could garbage-collect the task before it
  finished, silently dropping a state-update push to subscribed
  WebSocket clients (RUF006).

### Added

- **Backfilled tests for ``app.api.dependencies`` and
  ``app.bootstrap``.** ``tests/test_api_dependencies.py`` (24
  tests) covers ``_strict_oid_access_enabled`` env-var parsing,
  ``check_oid_access`` (auth disabled, missing header, invalid
  token, allowed OID, mismatched OID, lenient vs strict modes,
  malformed per-user config), and ``get_current_username``
  edge cases. ``tests/test_bootstrap.py`` (4 tests) verifies that
  ``create_app`` boots gracefully when ``frontend/dist`` and/or
  ``overlay_templates`` directories are missing, and exercises
  ``_split_csv_env``. Total backend tests grew from 853 → 883;
  ``--cov=app`` is at 82%.
- **Repository hygiene.** Added ``.editorconfig`` (LF endings,
  4-space Python, 2-space JS/TS/MD), ``.gitattributes`` (text=auto
  eol=lf with explicit binary classification and
  ``linguist-generated`` markers for lockfiles and the generated
  OpenAPI types), ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` summarising the dev loop and
  PR checklist, plus issue templates
  (``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,config}``)
  and a ``.github/pull_request_template.md``. ``dependabot.yml``
  now also tracks ``npm`` updates for ``frontend/`` (grouped by
  eslint / vitest / testing-library / react).
- **Frontend linting.** Added ESLint (flat config) with
  ``typescript-eslint``, ``eslint-plugin-react``,
  ``eslint-plugin-react-hooks``, and ``eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y``,
  plus Prettier and ``eslint-config-prettier``. New scripts in
  ``frontend/package.json``: ``lint``, ``lint:fix``, ``format``,
  ``format:check``. The ``lint`` step is now wired into
  ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` (frontend job) and into
  ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` as a ``local`` hook that runs
  ``npx eslint`` on changed ``.ts``/``.tsx`` files under
  ``frontend/src/``. Known dialog a11y findings and unused-import
  cleanups are intentionally kept as warnings so this lint baseline
  passes today; tightening lands in subsequent PRs.

### Security

- **Webhook SSRF guard.** ``app/api/webhooks.py`` now refuses to POST
  to URLs whose host resolves to a private (RFC 1918), loopback,
  link-local (including the ``169.254.169.254`` cloud-metadata
  endpoint), multicast, reserved (RFC 5737 / RFC 3849
  documentation), or unspecified address. Trusted-LAN deployments
  that legitimately call internal webhook receivers set
  ``WEBHOOKS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=true`` to opt out. Non-``http(s)``
  schemes are also rejected. DNS resolution failures pass through
  so flaky resolvers don't silently break valid webhook
  configurations.
- **`WWW-Authenticate` on 401 responses.** Per RFC 7235 §4.1, every
  401 from the auth ladders now carries a
  ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="<scoreboard|admin|overlay-server>"``
  header. The realm hint helps the OpenAPI / Swagger UI label the
  credential prompt and lets operators tell from access logs which
  ladder rejected a request. 403 semantics are preserved (invalid
  credential ≠ no credential).
- **Enriched unhandled-exception logging.** ``ExceptionLoggingMiddleware``
  now logs the request method, path, exception class, and request id
  in both the message text and as structured ``extra`` fields
  (``http_method``, ``http_path``, ``exc_class``) so JSON log
  consumers can query each axis without parsing the free-form
  message.

- **`TrustedHostMiddleware` (opt-in).** Set ``TRUSTED_HOSTS`` to a
  comma-separated list of public hostnames the deployment serves
  from; requests carrying a ``Host`` header outside the allow-list
  are rejected with HTTP 400 before any handler reads
  ``request.base_url``. Wildcard subdomains are honoured. Default:
  unset → no enforcement (backwards compatible).
- **CORS scaffolding (opt-in).** Set ``CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` to a
  comma-separated list of origins permitted to call the API
  cross-origin. ``*`` is deliberately rejected on this credentialed
  API; explicit origins only. ``Authorization``,
  ``Content-Type``, ``X-Request-ID``, and
  ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`` are forwarded so the existing auth
  flows and the new Bearer-subprotocol WebSocket handshake all keep
  working. Default: unset → same-origin only (backwards compatible).
- **CI security scanners.** New ``security-scan`` job in
  ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` runs Bandit (MEDIUM+ severity) over
  ``app/``, ``pip-audit --strict`` against both
  ``requirements.lock`` and ``requirements-dev.lock``, and
  ``npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`` against the frontend.
  Findings fail the job; suppression requires either a documented
  ``# nosec`` comment or an explicit advisory ignore.
- **`SECURITY.md`** — formal vulnerability-disclosure policy.
  Points reporters at GitHub's private vulnerability reporting,
  documents in-scope/out-of-scope surfaces, and links to the
  hardening reference (``AUTHENTICATION.md``).

- **Hashed credentials at rest.** New module ``app/password_hash.py``
  uses ``hashlib.scrypt`` (no new dependency) to mint salted hash
  records of the form ``scrypt$n=16384,r=8,p=1$<salt>$<hash>``. Three
  auth surfaces gained an opt-in hashed alternative — operators
  migrate without a flag day, since each surface accepts either the
  legacy plaintext or the new hash:
  - ``SCOREBOARD_USERS`` user entries may carry ``password_hash``
    instead of ``password``. When both are present, the hash wins
    so the migration doesn't leave both credentials valid.
  - ``OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD_HASH`` is honoured alongside the
    legacy ``OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD``. The match-report URL
    signing key follows whichever credential is configured, so
    rotating either one still invalidates outstanding signed URLs.
  - ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN_HASH`` is honoured alongside
    ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN``. When the hash is set, the security
    bootstrap skips auto-generation of the persisted plaintext
    file — a hash-only deployment keeps zero cleartext on the
    server side; the peer keeps the cleartext token.

  Mint a hash via ``python -m app.password_hash`` (interactive
  prompt) or ``echo -n 'pw' | python -m app.password_hash --stdin``.

  Hash verification with the default scrypt parameters costs ~50 ms
  per check, which would noticeably slow the React control UI's
  per-action API calls. ``PasswordAuthenticator`` now keeps a
  60-second per-process verify cache keyed on
  ``sha256(provided_token)`` so the hot path stays fast; the cache
  is automatically invalidated whenever ``SCOREBOARD_USERS`` is
  rotated.

- **Capability-style signed URLs for the gated match report.** New
  endpoint ``POST /api/v1/admin/match/{match_id}/sign-url`` (admin
  Bearer auth) returns a short-lived URL of the form
  ``/match/{id}/report?exp=<unix>&sig=<hmac>``. The legacy
  ``?token=<OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD>`` flow is preserved for
  backwards compatibility but operators should switch over: signed
  URLs do not embed the admin password, expire automatically (TTL
  bounded to ``[60, 30 days]``, default ``86 400 s``), and rotating
  the password invalidates every outstanding signature.
- **Bearer subprotocol auth on ``/api/v1/ws``.** The WebSocket route
  now prefers ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer, <token>`` over the
  legacy ``?token=`` query parameter. The handshake echoes the
  selected subprotocol so browser clients accept the connection.
  Resolution order: subprotocol → ``Authorization`` header → legacy
  ``?token=`` query (deprecated). Tokens no longer need to appear
  in URL access logs or HTTP ``Referer`` headers for browser clients.

- ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN`` is now **auto-generated and persisted on
  first start** instead of leaving the seven overlay-server mutation
  endpoints (``POST /api/state/{id}``, ``/create/overlay/{id}``,
  ``/delete/overlay/{id}``, ``/api/raw_config/{id}``,
  ``/api/theme/{id}/{name}``) unauthenticated by default. Resolution
  order at startup:
  1. ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN_DISABLED=true`` keeps the legacy
     fail-open behaviour and logs a ``CRITICAL`` startup warning.
  2. ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN=<value>`` already set wins.
  3. Otherwise the bootstrap reads / mints a token at
     ``data/.overlay_server_token`` (mode ``0o600``) and injects it
     into ``os.environ`` so the rest of the app picks it up
     transparently. The same value is reused across restarts so an
     external ``CustomOverlayBackend`` peer does not need to be
     re-configured.

  **Operator action:** when an external overlay server points at this
  app via ``APP_CUSTOM_OVERLAY_URL``, both sides must use the same
  ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN``. Either set it explicitly on both, or read
  the auto-generated value from ``data/.overlay_server_token`` after
  the first start. To restore the previous unauthenticated behaviour
  on a trusted LAN, set ``OVERLAY_SERVER_TOKEN_DISABLED=true``.
- ``SCOREBOARD_USERS`` left unset now emits a startup ``WARNING``
  (previously silent) so the open-API posture is visible in the
  startup tail. ``SCOREBOARD_USERS_DISABLED=true`` silences the
  warning for trusted-LAN deployments.
- New ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware`` adds baseline response headers on
  every request: ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff``,
  ``Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin``, and a
  ``Permissions-Policy`` that denies geolocation/microphone/camera by
  default. HTML responses additionally carry a ``Content-Security-Policy``
  (locked to ``'self'`` + inline scripts/styles to keep the existing
  match report rendering) and ``X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN``. The
  ``/overlay/*`` routes get a relaxed ``frame-ancestors *`` so OBS
  browser sources can still embed them. Operators can override the
  CSP / referrer / permissions strings via ``SECURITY_CSP``,
  ``SECURITY_REFERRER_POLICY``, ``SECURITY_PERMISSIONS_POLICY`` and
  opt into HSTS by setting ``SECURITY_HSTS_SECONDS`` (off by default
  to avoid locking out non-HTTPS deployments).
- New ``AuthRateLimitMiddleware`` watches ``/api/v1/`` and ``/manage``
  for repeated 401/403 responses and blocks further requests from
  the same IP with HTTP 429 once a per-IP threshold is reached. This
  is a defence-in-depth backstop for brute-force attempts against
  ``/api/v1/admin/login`` and the ``verify_api_key`` /
  ``require_admin`` dependencies. Tunables:
  ``AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_FAILURES`` (default 10),
  ``AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`` (default 60),
  ``AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_BLOCK_SECONDS`` (default 60). The bucket is
  reset only by the sliding window — successful responses to public
  endpoints under the same prefix (``/api/v1/admin/status``,
  ``/manage`` itself) do not clear failures, so an attacker cannot
  launder login attempts by interleaving status requests. The
  client identifier is sourced from ``scope["client"]`` only;
  client-supplied ``X-Forwarded-For`` headers are ignored to defeat
  spoofing. Operators behind a reverse proxy must configure uvicorn
  with ``--proxy-headers`` / ``--forwarded-allow-ips`` so the ASGI
  scope reflects the real remote IP.
- ``/api/v1/`` JSON responses now carry ``Cache-Control: no-store``
  unless the handler explicitly sets a different policy, so
  intermediaries cannot cache authenticated payloads.
- ``PUT /api/v1/customization`` now caps payload size and validates
  every value:
  - At most 64 top-level keys per request.
  - Only scalar JSON types (string, boolean, number, null) are
    accepted — arrays and nested objects are rejected so the
    deep-merge into the broadcast state cannot be used to inflate
    the WebSocket payload.
  - String values capped at 256 characters (8 KiB for logo URLs to
    accommodate base64 ``data:image/...`` payloads).
  - Logo URLs must use ``http(s)://`` or ``data:image/...`` schemes.
    ``javascript:``, ``vbscript:``, ``data:text/html``, ``file://``,
    etc. are rejected before persistence and broadcast.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- React control UI: reversed the order of the four secondary toggles
  on the bottom HUD bar. New order, left → right (closest to the
  match timer first): undo, simple-mode, preview, visibility. Undo
  is the most reached-for action during play, so it now sits closest
  to the primary side of the bar.
- Docs: regenerated README screenshots to reflect the bottom-HUD
  toggle reorder and the recent control-UI / config-panel /
  match-report tweaks.
- Performance: audit-log undo (``POST /api/v1/game/undo`` and the
  per-type ``add_*(undo=True)`` flag) now appends a single tombstone
  record instead of rewriting the entire ``data/audit_<hash>.jsonl``
  file. Reads continue to expose the same logical view — tombstones
  and the records they reference are filtered out — and the file is
  still truncated on match end / ``reset`` so tombstones do not
  accumulate across matches. Brings undo cost down from O(N) to
  O(1) per call.
- Performance: ``GET /api/v1/matches`` now reads a compact
  ``data/matches/index.jsonl`` summary file (one line per archive)
  instead of opening and JSON-parsing every match snapshot on disk.
  The index is appended on each ``archive_match`` and rewritten on
  ``delete_match`` / ``delete_for_oid``; missing indices are
  rebuilt on demand from the on-disk files, so upgrades from
  earlier builds do not need a manual migration step.
- Performance: ``GameService`` action methods (``add_point``,
  ``add_set``, ``add_timeout``, ``change_serve``, ``set_score``,
  ``set_sets_value``, ``set_rules``, ``reset``, ``set_visibility``,
  ``set_simple_mode``, ``update_customization``) compute
  ``GameStateResponse`` once per call and reuse the same object for
  the broadcast, webhook fan-out, archive payload, and HTTP
  response. The previous code path called ``get_state`` 2-5 times
  per action, each call iterating ``sets_limit`` and recomputing
  side-switch / match-point info.
- Performance: ``WSHub`` gained a ``broadcast_payload_json`` path
  that accepts an already-encoded JSON string. ``GameService._broadcast``
  uses ``GameStateResponse.model_dump_json`` so the WebSocket
  payload is serialized in a single pass instead of going through an
  intermediate ``model_dump`` → dict → ``json.dumps`` round-trip.
- Performance: React control UI — ``TeamPanel`` and ``CenterPanel``
  are now wrapped in ``React.memo`` so a WebSocket state push no
  longer re-renders the full scoreboard subtree when only the
  relevant team's props changed. Button-colour derivations in
  ``App.tsx`` are collapsed into a single ``useMemo`` to keep
  referential identity stable across renders.
- Performance: React control UI — ``ConfigPanel`` tracks
  unsaved-changes via an explicit ``isDirty`` flag toggled by the
  mutation paths (``updateField``, theme apply) instead of running
  a double ``JSON.stringify`` comparison of the full customization
  object on every keystroke.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- React control UI: when the overlay preview is hidden, the centre
  column now renders a "points history strip" in the slot the
  preview would have occupied — a two-row table (one row per team)
  with the team's coloured logo marker on the left and a
  chronological sequence of action chips to the right. Each
  audit-log event becomes a chip on its team's row only, so the
  column visually maps to the moment the action happened. Lets
  operators read momentum and recent corrections at a glance
  without the bandwidth / visual cost of the live preview iframe.

  Chip vocabulary:
  * ``+1`` / ``−1`` for an ``add_point`` forward / undo entry.
  * Star icon when a team's ``sets`` count advances by 1
    without ending the match. Detected via the post-state diff
    in the audit response, so it covers both the explicit
    ``add_set`` action and — far more common — the set-winning
    ``add_point`` (which the backend logs as ``add_point``
    only, with the new ``sets`` count carried in the result
    block). Struck-star variant added beside the original star
    when the operator undoes the set-winning point: detected
    via a React state diff (``team_X.sets`` drops between
    refetches), since the audit log alone can't reconstruct
    the popped forward.
  * Trophy icon when the same sets diff also flips
    ``match_finished`` to ``true``. Struck-trophy variant
    appended when ``match_finished`` flips back to ``false``
    (operator undoes the match-winning point).
  * Clock icon for ``add_timeout``; struck-clock for any undo
    of a timeout — same rule as ``point_undo`` so the strip is
    visually consistent across action types. When the undo is
    non-adjacent (some action happened in between), the
    classifier additionally synthesizes the missing forward
    chip from the post-state timeout diff (the forward record
    was physically removed by ``pop_last_forward`` so we never
    see it directly) and places it before the first in-between
    record that observed the bumped count, recovering the
    timeline the operator saw before clicking undo.
  * Pencil icon plus the absolute new score (e.g. ``15``,
    ``0``) for a ``set_score`` manual correction. No-op
    corrections (typed value matches the current value) are
    suppressed via a per-(set, team) running cache.

  Forward chips are sticky across refetches. When
  ``pop_last_forward`` deletes the original forward record on
  an undo, the hook carries the prior chip forward (it remembers
  the last surfaced events) and appends the struck-undo chip
  beside it instead of letting the original silently vanish or
  morph into its struck variant. So undoing a set-winning point
  shows ``[+1, ★, −1, ⊘★]`` rather than just ``[⊘★]``, matching
  the way ``point_undo`` already laid out next to ``point_add``.

  Chips render at ``opacity: 0.7`` so they recede behind the
  score buttons and alert pills they sit next to instead of
  competing with them.

  Implementation:
  * New ``frontend/src/hooks/useRecentEvents.ts`` (replaces the
    earlier ``useRecentPoints``) fetches ``GET /api/v1/audit``
    only while the preview is hidden, and refetches when the
    match scoring key (sum of all set scores + sets won +
    timeouts per team) changes — so unrelated state pushes
    (visibility toggles, simple-mode changes) don't trigger
    redundant network calls, but a timeout immediately surfaces
    its clock chip rather than waiting for the next scoring
    event. Audit fetch limit derives from the requested window
    (``Math.max(40, max * 3)``). Failed fetches clear the strip
    rather than leave stale chips.
  * ``frontend/src/components/PointsHistoryStrip.tsx`` renders
    two rows × N cells with inline-SVG icons for clock,
    clock-undo, trophy and pencil. Hairline divider between
    the team marker and the action cells, plus a row-to-row
    separator between the two team rows. Receives team
    colours, logos and names from ``App.tsx`` via
    ``ScoreboardView`` and ``CenterPanel``, so the marker
    honours ``followTeamColors`` and the per-team customisation
    overrides; absent logos fall back to a flat coloured
    circle. ``max`` is set to ``8`` on desktop / portrait and
    ``5`` on landscape phones (compact layout) so the strip
    never overflows the centre slot.

### Changed

- React control UI: replaced the horizontal set selector with a
  compact current-set indicator, freeing horizontal space in the
  centre column for the new points history strip.
- Points-history chips now use a stable composite key
  (``ts/team/kind/value``) instead of the array index, so the
  sliding window no longer remounts every chip when the oldest
  event drops off — preserves chip state and avoids unnecessary
  reconciliation.
- README screenshots regenerated; the portrait capture now shows
  the points history strip in the centre slot.

### Fixed

- UNO overlay preview size now matches the custom overlays
  (``cardHeight`` hoisted to the shared scope), so the iframe no
  longer renders at a different aspect than what the broadcast
  output will show.
- Points history strip occasionally missed the chip for the action
  that just happened — it would only surface together with the next
  action's chip. Root cause was a race between the optimistic state
  update in ``useGameState.addPoint`` and the audit ``GET`` that
  ``useRecentEvents`` fires when its ``scoringKey`` changes: the
  optimistic write bumped the key immediately, the GET often beat
  the in-flight ``POST``'s ``action_log.append``, and the follow-up
  WS broadcast carried the same state so the key didn't change
  again. Fixed by introducing a separate ``confirmedState`` slot in
  ``useGameState`` that only advances on authoritative updates
  (initial fetch, action response, WS push) and feeding *that* to
  ``useRecentEvents`` — so the audit refetch trigger no longer
  outruns the server's acknowledgement.

---

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-02

### Security

- `/match/{match_id}/report` is no longer unauthenticated by default.
  Match snapshots bundle the audit log and full team customization,
  which is strictly more sensitive than live overlay state. The route
  now requires `OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD` (Bearer header *or*
  `?token=` query string) unless the operator explicitly opts in to
  open access via `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true`. When neither is
  configured the route returns 503.
- `app/match_report._team_color` validates customization-supplied
  hex colours against a strict `^#([0-9a-fA-F]{3}|[0-9a-fA-F]{6})$`
  regex before interpolating into the CSS template, closing a CSS
  injection vector where a malformed value (e.g. `#a;}b`) could
  inject styles or break the page.

### Fixed

- `app/api/match_archive` filenames now include microseconds
  (`%Y%m%dT%H%M%S_<μs>Z`), so two archives in the same wall-clock
  second produce distinct `match_id` values instead of silently
  overwriting. Tests no longer need `time.sleep` workarounds.
- `app/api/action_log` per-OID writer serialization now goes
  through a fixed-size pool of 256 locks indexed by `hash(oid)`,
  replacing an LRU dict. The LRU could evict a lock while one
  thread was still inside the critical section, letting a
  concurrent caller for the same OID mint a fresh lock and enter
  the read/append/pop section at the same time — corrupting the
  JSONL audit file. The pool gives bounded memory without that
  race; unrelated OIDs that hash-collide just see negligible
  spurious serialization.
- Match report timeline drops "orphan" undo rows. Under the
  unified undo, `action_log.pop_last_forward` physically removes
  the original forward record and the caller appends a new
  `undo=True` audit entry. `_collapse_undos` then could not pair
  it with any prior forward and was leaving the orphan visible
  as an unanchored row referencing an action that no longer
  exists in the log. The collapse pass now drops those orphans
  entirely; paired collapses (forwards still followed by their
  explicit undo, e.g. legacy snapshots) keep working as before.
- `WebhookDispatcher` is now drained on application shutdown via
  `router_lifespan` calling `webhook_dispatcher.shutdown()` with
  `cancel_futures=True`, so a hung outbound delivery cannot keep
  the process alive past exit. Previously the executor was left
  to Python's default `atexit` cleanup, which waits for in-flight
  workers — usually fast (5 s per-target timeout) but visible in
  systemd unit shutdown latency.
- The cached `GameSession.undoable_forward_count` (source of truth
  for `GameStateResponse.can_undo`) now updates *only* after the
  audit-log append succeeds. A filesystem error during `_audit`
  used to leave the counter overstating the on-disk truth; now
  the counter and `count_undoable_forwards` always agree.
- `action_log.pop_last_forward` rewrites the audit file atomically
  via mkstemp + `os.replace` (matching `match_archive`'s pattern).
  Previously a crash mid-write would truncate the file and lose
  every preceding record.
- The `set_end` webhook now reports the set that just ended, not
  the set the session has advanced to. Both `add_point`'s
  set-winning point and `add_set` were reading
  `session.current_set` *after* it was incremented, so consumers
  saw `set_number=2` when set 1 just ended (or `set_number=4`
  after set 3 ended, etc.). The match-winning case is unchanged
  because `current_set` doesn't advance past the deciding set.
- The audit log now records the *final* score of the set the
  action operated on. Previously, set-winning add_point and
  add_set entries showed `team_1.score=0, team_2.score=0` because
  the snapshot was taken after `current_set` advanced to the new,
  empty set. Each entry gains a `score_set` field so a reader can
  see the set the score belongs to (usually equal to
  `current_set`, but lower on set-winning actions).
- HUD: show the Reset button on finished matches; primary
  controls relaid out on the left; match timer centred in its
  spacer.
- Match report: fall back to the rally axis when timestamps are
  non-monotonic so the score-evolution charts still render.
- Match report: prefer the team-identity colour over the per-team
  accent; set-winning points are now grouped under the set they
  completed.
- Match report: exclude `set_score` events from the longest-rally
  computation.
- Match report: respect the explicit Start-match anchor on the
  report side so the time axis matches the HUD timer.
- Layout: shrink the overlay preview on landscape phones; reverted
  the inline score-history experiment that broke alignment on
  small screens.
- PWA: exempt `/match` and `/matches` from the service-worker
  navigation fallback so the report and matches index render
  server-side instead of falling back to `index.html`.
- Match-end: respect the per-session `sets_limit` so best-of-1
  ends after one set instead of waiting for the configured
  best-of-N target.
- Rules UI: hide the "Points / final set" input when best-of-1 is
  selected (the field is irrelevant without a deciding set).
- Rules: keep the midpoint alert visible after the leader scores
  past the trigger point so operators don't miss it on a fast
  rally cluster.

### Changed

- Match report set-by-set table now annotates timeouts inline next
  to each score: a cell renders ``25 (2)`` when the team called
  two timeouts in that set and bare ``25`` when none. The
  previous separate "Timeouts (final set)" row has been removed —
  the per-set view is more useful and survives across sets, where
  the old row only showed the deciding-set count (timeout
  counters reset on each set transition).
- Match report "Biggest comeback" highlight reads more clearly.
  English copy was ``"down {n}, won {set}"`` — easy to misread as
  "won by 1" when ``{set}`` was a small number. Now reads
  ``"down {n} in set {set}"``. Romance-locale strings tightened
  similarly so the trailing ``{set}`` always sits behind the word
  for "set" (German already did this).
- Unified the two undo entry points behind one audit-log stack.
  Previously ``add_*(undo=True)`` and ``POST /game/undo`` had
  divergent stack semantics: the per-type flag only reverted state
  and appended an undo record, leaving the original forward record
  in the log. A follow-up generic undo would then pop the fantasma
  forward and double-revert. Now both paths pop the matching
  forward before applying the state-level inverse, so the two
  cannot drift.
  - ``action_log.pop_last_forward`` accepts a new ``team`` filter
    used by the per-type branches; ``action_log.peek_last_forward``
    is the read-only sibling used by ``GameService.undo_last`` to
    locate the next undoable record without consuming it (the
    dispatched per-type call performs the actual pop).
  - ``GameStateResponse.can_undo`` is a new boolean derived from a
    cached ``GameSession.undoable_forward_count``. Lets frontends
    drive the global Undo button from the server-side stack
    instead of maintaining their own LIFO. The counter is
    rehydrated from the audit log on session creation.
  - The bundled React control UI now calls
    ``actions.undoLast()`` (POST ``/game/undo``) for the bottom-bar
    Undo button and consumes ``state.can_undo`` for the disabled
    flag. Per-team double-tap gestures continue to use the per-type
    flag — the unification means they pop from the same stack.
    ``useActionHistory`` is no longer wired into ``App.tsx``.
  - Behaviour change for callers of the per-type
    ``add_*(undo=True)`` API: when no matching forward record
    exists in the log, the call still falls through to the
    state-level undo (preserving backward compatibility for
    callers manipulating state via ``set_score``/etc.), but it
    will not bump the undo counter — so ``can_undo`` only flips
    based on real audit-log activity.

### Added

- Operators can now delete archived match snapshots from the
  ``/matches/index.html`` page. New checkbox column with select-all
  in the header, a "Delete selected" button in the toolbar, and a
  per-row "Delete" button. Backed by a new
  ``DELETE /matches/{match_id}`` route gated by a stricter
  ``_check_admin_access`` helper that ignores
  ``MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true`` — public mode grants read-only
  access, deletion always requires the admin token. Helper:
  ``match_archive.delete_match(match_id)``.
- Match-rules configuration is now editable per-session. New
  config-panel section "Match rules" exposes:
  * Indoor / Beach mode toggle (defaults: 25/15/5 indoor, 21/15/3
    beach). Switching mode applies the canonical preset; per-field
    overrides in the same call still win.
  * Sets selector (1 / 3 / 5).
  * Points-per-set and points-per-final-set inputs.
  * "Reset defaults for mode" button.

  Backend additions: ``app/api/match_rules.py`` (presets +
  side-switch helpers), ``GameSession.mode`` (persisted via
  ``session_meta``), new ``POST /api/v1/session/rules`` endpoint
  with ``mode``/``points_limit``/``points_limit_last_set``/
  ``sets_limit``/``reset_to_defaults`` body. ``GameStateResponse``
  carries ``config.mode`` so frontends can render the active
  preset.
- Beach side-switch tracker (§2.3). Beach matches switch sides
  every 7 combined points in non-tiebreak sets and every 5 in the
  tiebreak. ``GameStateResponse.beach_side_switch`` now surfaces
  ``{interval, points_in_set, next_switch_at, points_until_switch,
  is_switch_pending}`` for consumers; the field is ``null`` for
  indoor matches so existing payloads are unaffected. The control
  UI renders an inline indicator below the set pagination ("Side
  switch in N" → orange "Switch sides now" pulse on the boundary
  point), with i18n strings in all six locales.
- `GET /api/v1/links` returns a `latest_match_report` URL pointing
  at the most recent archived match snapshot for the session — but
  only when `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true`. The control UI's "Links"
  configuration section surfaces it as a clickable / copyable entry
  ("Latest match report" / "Último informe de partido" in 6
  locales). The token is intentionally never embedded in the URL,
  so gated deployments can keep their match reports private without
  the link section ever leaking the admin token.
- New browseable HTML match-history index at
  `GET /matches/index.html?oid=<OID>`. Lists every archived match
  for the OID with sets, duration, end-date, and a per-row link to
  the full report. Same auth gate as `/match/{id}/report`
  (`OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD` Bearer header / `?token=`, or open
  via `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true`). The page propagates the token
  to the per-match report links so a click-through doesn't
  re-prompt for credentials. `GET /api/v1/links` surfaces it as
  `match_history` (only when `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true` and the
  session has at least one archive), and the React control UI's
  Links section renders it alongside `latest_match_report` in 6
  locales ("Match history" / "Historial de partidos" / …).
- Session-level state survives process restarts. Per-OID flags
  (`simple` mode, custom `points_limit`, `points_limit_last_set`,
  `sets_limit`) used to live only in memory and were silently dropped
  on deploy/crash. They are now persisted to
  `data/session_meta_<sha256[:20]>.json` on every state mutation and
  rehydrated by `SessionManager.get_or_create` before any caller-supplied
  override is applied. Match data (scores, sets, current set, serve,
  timeouts) was already round-tripped through the overlay state store
  for local overlays and through the cloud for `overlays.uno`, so this
  closes the last in-memory gap. Deleting a custom overlay from
  `/manage` now also removes the session and the meta file.
- Outbound webhooks fired on game events. The new
  `WebhookDispatcher` reads
  `WEBHOOKS_URL`/`WEBHOOKS_SECRET`/`WEBHOOKS_EVENTS` (single endpoint)
  or `WEBHOOKS_JSON` (list of endpoints, optionally per-event-filtered)
  and POSTs `{event, oid, ts, state, details}` payloads on `set_end`,
  `match_end`, `timeout`, and `serve_change`. Bodies are signed with
  HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>`) when a secret is
  configured. Delivery is fire-and-forget on a small thread pool with
  a configurable timeout — failures are logged but never break the
  triggering action.
- Per-OID action audit log at
  `data/audit_<sha256[:20]>.jsonl`. Every state-mutating
  `GameService` call appends `{ts, action, params, result}` where
  `result` is a compact post-state snapshot. Exposed read-only via
  `GET /api/v1/audit?oid=...&limit=100`. Cleared on `reset()` and
  bundled into per-match snapshots on match end (see below).
- Match history archive. When a session transitions to
  `match_finished`, the final state, customization, audit log, and
  match config are bundled into a snapshot at
  `data/matches/match_<sha256(oid)[:20]>_<UTC-ISO8601>.json`.
  Two new read endpoints: `GET /api/v1/matches[?oid=…]` returns
  summaries newest-first, `GET /api/v1/matches/{match_id}` returns
  the full snapshot. `GameSession` now tracks `match_started_at`
  (persisted, reset on `reset()` and after every successful archive)
  so durations are accurate.
- Server-side undo stack. New `POST /api/v1/game/undo` pops the most
  recent forward `add_point` / `add_set` / `add_timeout` from the
  audit log and applies the inverse. Non-undoable forward records
  (e.g. `change_serve`, `set_score`, `reset`) stay in the log so
  the timeline is preserved; undo just walks past them. Returns
  `success=false, message="Nothing to undo."` when no eligible
  record exists. The per-type `undo=True` flag continues to work
  and now shares the same stack — see the **Changed** section
  above for the unification details.
- Print-friendly match report at `GET /match/{match_id}/report`.
  Server-rendered self-contained HTML page with hero scoreboard
  (team names, sets won, winner badge, team colours from the
  archived customization), set-by-set scores table, match facts
  (start/end timestamps, format, audit count), and an action
  timeline. A `@media print` block makes the page render cleanly
  via the browser's built-in "Save as PDF" workflow. Auth model:
  by default the route requires `OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD`
  (Bearer header or `?token=` query); set
  `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC=true` to make it openly addressable by
  hash-prefixed `match_id` instead — see the **Security** section
  above.
- OS-aware light/dark theme for the React control UI. The
  `darkMode` setting now accepts `'auto'` (default) in addition to
  `true` / `false` — when `'auto'`, the UI follows the OS
  `prefers-color-scheme` media query and updates live as the
  preference changes. The theme button in the bottom HUD now cycles
  through `auto → dark → light → auto`, with a `brightness_auto`
  icon and a localised "Theme: follow system" tooltip in the auto
  state. Existing localStorage values continue to work unchanged.
- Explicit match start. The HUD gains a "Start match" button that
  anchors the live match timer (rendered in the centre HUD spacer)
  and the report-side time axis. Theme and fullscreen buttons
  moved out of the scoreboard toolbar into the bottom HUD to
  declutter the bar.
- Match report enhancements layered on top of the initial
  print-friendly report:
  * Richer print layout with hero, set-by-set table, and action
    timeline polish; pregame records trimmed and unplayed sets
    hidden so finished best-of-3s don't render four empty
    columns.
  * Score-evolution charts can plot a time-elapsed X-axis (with
    automatic fallback to the rally index when timestamps aren't
    monotonic), and Highlights / chart axes / contrast / print
    dialog received a polish pass.
  * `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC_DELETE` env flag lets operators expose
    the delete affordance on `/matches/index.html` without
    handing out the admin token; OIDs in archived snapshots are
    redacted before render so a public report URL never leaks
    the session identifier.
- In-match alert system. The control UI now surfaces match-finished,
  set-point, and match-point indicators in the centre HUD, and an
  indoor deciding-set midpoint alert (frontend-driven, fires when
  the leader reaches half of the deciding-set target). Alerts
  display the relevant team via a directional triangle icon
  instead of an `[T1]` / `[T2]` label suffix, with i18n strings in
  all six locales.

### Removed

- Deleted the orphan `frontend/src/hooks/useActionHistory.ts` hook
  and its tests, plus the `ACTION_HISTORY_LIMIT` constant in
  `frontend/src/constants.ts`. The bundled React UI now drives the
  global Undo button straight off `state.can_undo` and
  `actions.undoLast()`, so the client-side LIFO stack the hook
  used to maintain is no longer needed. Pure cleanup — no
  externally visible behaviour change.

### Documentation

- README endpoint table lists `/api/v1/audit`, `/api/v1/matches`,
  `/api/v1/matches/{id}`, `/api/v1/game/undo`,
  `/api/v1/session/rules`, and `/match/{id}/report`. Configuration
  table documents the new `MATCH_REPORT_PUBLIC` env var.
- `FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT.md` gains a dedicated section for
  `POST /api/v1/game/undo` plus a "Two undo APIs, one stack" note
  explaining that `add_*(undo=true)` and the new generic endpoint
  consume from the same audit-log stack and can be mixed safely;
  also flags the deliberate footgun that `state.can_undo` reflects
  audit-log truth (not raw scoreboard state).
- `AGENTS.md` source-tree reflects the new modules
  (`app/api/match_rules.py`, `app/api/action_log.py`,
  `app/api/match_archive.py`, `app/api/webhooks.py`,
  `app/api/session_persistence.py`, `app/match_report.py`).

---

## [5.0.4] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- The `mosaic` overlay style (`/overlay/{id}?style=mosaic`) now scales to
  fit the current viewport without scrolling. The grid picks the best
  cols × rows split for the number of available styles, and each
  preview iframe is cropped to its reported render bounds and centred
  inside its cell, so all styles are visible at once and re-fit on
  window resize. Previously the page used a fixed 580px-min column with
  a 200px height cap, producing a vertically scrolling list once more
  than a few styles were available. Mobile viewports are pinned to
  `100dvh` so the grid stays inside the visible area when browser
  chrome shrinks/expands, and the iframe sizing handshake was
  rewritten around the resize observer's content-box plus a single
  `requestAnimationFrame` to remove the brief flicker on first paint
  and on resize (`#222`).

### Dependencies

- Bump `fastapi` floor from `>=0.115.0` to `>=0.136.1` (`#218`).
- Bump `uvicorn` floor from `>=0.32.0` to `>=0.46.0` (`#216`).
- Bump `httpx` (dev) floor from `>=0.27.0` to `>=0.28.1` (`#214`).
- Bump `pytest` (dev) floor from `>=9.0.2` to `>=9.0.3` (`#219`).
- Bump `pytest-asyncio` (dev) floor from `>=0.23.0` to `>=1.3.0` (`#213`).
- Bump base Docker image `python` from `3.12-slim` to `3.14-slim` (`#220`).
- Bump base Docker image `node` from `20-alpine` to `25-alpine` (`#221`).
- Bump `actions/setup-node` from `4` to `6` (`#217`).
- Bump `actions/upload-artifact` from `4` to `7` (`#212`).
- Bump `docker/setup-buildx-action` from `3` to `4` (`#215`).

---

## [5.0.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Keyboard activation on the score and timeout buttons in the React
  control UI: Enter and Space now trigger the same single-tap / rapid
  double-tap / long-press gestures previously only reachable by mouse
  or touch, closing a WCAG 2.1.1 (Keyboard) gap. Implemented in the
  shared `useDoubleTap` hook and covered by new keyboard test cases.
- Frontend coverage gate in CI. `vitest run --coverage` is now enforced
  on every PR via `npm run test:coverage`; thresholds are pinned tightly
  below current coverage to act as a regression floor and the lcov
  report is uploaded as a CI artifact alongside the existing backend
  coverage artifact.

### Changed

- Centralised frontend timing and capacity tunables into a new
  `frontend/src/constants.ts` (`ACTION_HISTORY_LIMIT`, `DOUBLE_TAP_MS`,
  `LONG_PRESS_MS`, `HUD_AUTO_HIDE_MS`, `WS_PING_INTERVAL_MS`,
  `WS_RECONNECT_MS`). Previously these magic numbers lived inline in
  `App.tsx`, `useDoubleTap.ts`, `api/websocket.ts` and `useGameState.ts`;
  call sites now import from one place so future tuning is discoverable.
- Bumped the client-side undo history cap from 200 to 300 so a 5-set
  match with extended deuces is fully covered without truncation.
- Refactored the client-side undo state out of `App.tsx` into a
  dedicated `useActionHistory` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useActionHistory.ts`).
  The hook owns the bounded stack, exposes a small testable API
  (`push`, `undoLast`, `popMatching`, `clear`) and uses a ref-mirrored
  state so rapid undo dispatches see the latest history even between
  React batches. Behaviour is unchanged; the hook now has dedicated
  unit tests covering the truncation path and the rapid-undo case.
- Internationalization is now correctly described in `README.md` as the
  React control UI being available in six locales (English, Spanish,
  Portuguese, Italian, French, German), and the bullet has been moved
  from the REST API section to "User and Overlay Management" where it
  belongs.
- README screenshots are now captured at `deviceScaleFactor: 1` instead
  of `2`, cutting the in-tree screenshot bundle from ~2.9 MB to ~1.1 MB
  with no loss of legibility. Regenerated every PNG under
  `docs/screenshots/` against the new setting.
- README screenshot section refreshed to reference the current mosaic
  outputs (`06-overlay-mosaic-full.png`, `07-overlay-mosaic-simple.png`)
  produced by `scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs`, replacing the stale
  `06-overlay-default.png` / `07-overlay-clear-jersey.png` /
  `08-overlay-mosaic.png` entries.
- `AGENTS.md` now mandates regenerating screenshots
  (`bash scripts/screenshots/run.sh`) on any change that affects the
  look of an operator-facing surface, and mandates a `CHANGELOG.md`
  entry on every user-visible change.

### Fixed

- Doc drift: directory-tree blocks in `AGENTS.md` and `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
  still referenced pre-TypeScript-migration filenames (`App.jsx`,
  `i18n.jsx`, `theme.js`, `api/client.js`). Updated to the actual `.tsx`
  / `.ts` files and added the generated `api/schema.d.ts` entry.
- `ControlButtons` declared a `matchFinished` prop that no consumer ever
  read; it was forwarded `App.tsx` → `ScoreboardView` → `ControlButtons`
  for no effect. Removed across all three layers (and from the test
  fixture). Docstring also refreshed to match the current button set
  (visibility, preview, simple-mode, undo, fullscreen, dark-mode).

---

## [5.0.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Double-tap to undo on the timeout button in the React control UI, mirroring
  the existing double-tap-to-undo gesture on the score button. The shared
  press-gesture detector has been extracted into a `useDoubleTap` hook so both
  buttons stay in sync (`frontend/src/hooks/useDoubleTap.ts`) (`#208`).

### Changed

- Undo behaviour in the React control UI: the bottom-bar undo button no longer
  toggles an "undo mode" — clicking it immediately reverts the most recent
  action, and clicking it again reverts the action before that, walking back
  through a bounded history (200 entries) of points, sets, and timeouts. The
  button is disabled when the history is empty. Reset and logout clear the
  history. Translations updated across all six locales (`ctrl.undoOn` /
  `ctrl.undoOff` replaced with `ctrl.undoLast`) (`#208`).

### Fixed

- Undoing a set-winning point now works correctly. Previously, after a winning
  point advanced the session to the next set, both the score-button double-tap
  and the undo button silently no-opped because the backend was looking at the
  new (empty) set's score. `GameManager.add_game(undo=True)` now falls back to
  the prior set when the current one has no score for the requested team,
  allowing the existing un-win cascade to fire as intended. Note: timeouts are
  a single per-team counter (not historical per-set), so undoing a set-winning
  point cannot restore the prior set's timeouts — the limitation is unchanged
  (`#208`).

---

## [5.0.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Swipe navigation between scoreboard and configuration in the React control
  UI: a horizontal left-swipe on the scoreboard opens the config panel and a
  right-swipe returns to the scoreboard. The gesture is suppressed when the
  touch starts on an interactive element (buttons, inputs, sliders, switches,
  links, contenteditable) so taps, long-presses, and slider drags keep their
  default behavior. Implemented in `frontend/src/hooks/useSwipeNavigation.ts`
  (`#197`, `#198`).
- `?control=<id>` is now accepted as a backward-compatible alias for `?oid=<id>`
  on every API endpoint that takes the OID via query string (REST routes, the
  `/ws` WebSocket, and the request-logging middleware) and on the React
  control UI's initial-OID lookup. Either parameter resolves to the same
  overlay; passing both prefers `oid` (`#196`).

### Changed

- Config panel save UX: the "Save" button is now disabled (kept visible)
  until a setting that needs to be persisted to the overlay actually changes,
  making it visually obvious which controls apply directly versus which
  require an explicit save without the bottom bar reflowing. Leaving the
  panel via the back arrow, a browser back/edge-swipe gesture, or the in-app
  right-swipe now prompts the user before discarding pending edits
  (`config.unsavedChangesConfirm` translated for EN/ES/PT/IT/FR/DE)
  (`#200`, `#201`).

### Fixed

- Disabled config-panel bottom buttons now render with a clearly greyed-out
  style so it is obvious when an action is unavailable (`#202`, `#203`).
- Scoreboard control bar stays pinned on tablets and desktops; the auto-hide
  effect was split so the manual toggle keeps working on tablet form factors
  (`#204`).

### Dependencies

- Bump `postcss` from 8.5.8 to 8.5.12 in `frontend/` (`#206`).

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- In-process overlay engine: `LocalOverlayBackend` serves Jinja2 overlay
  templates and broadcasts state to OBS via WebSocket entirely in-process — no
  external overlay server required. Persists overlay state to JSON files, debounces
  WS broadcasts at 50 ms, and exposes 16 bundled templates out of the box
  (`#145`, `#143`).
- Custom overlay manager: password-protected `/manage` admin page (vanilla JS,
  no React) with CRUD for custom overlays. `GET`/`POST /api/v1/admin/custom-overlays`
  and `DELETE /api/v1/admin/custom-overlays/{name}`; optional `copy_from` param
  deep-clones an existing overlay's config on creation (`#146`, `#160`).
- Standalone `/preview` page: full-screen preview SPA route with a low-opacity
  toolbar for zoom −/+, dark/light backdrop toggle, and native fullscreen. Preview
  URL encoded in `/api/v1/links` for both custom and overlays.uno OIDs (`#163`).
- Per-session style override in preview: discreet style `<select>` in the
  `/preview` toolbar lets a remote viewer render with a different template via the
  existing `?style=` param without changing the session's saved `preferredStyle`
  used for streaming. Selector appears only when the server advertises more than
  one style; preview URL gains a `styles=` hint from `/api/v1/links` (`#183`).
- Mosaic preview grid: `?style=mosaic` on `/overlay/{id}` renders all overlay
  layouts side-by-side in a responsive iframe grid for at-a-glance style selection.
  A new `get_renderable_styles()` list on `OverlayStateStore` is a superset of the
  user-selectable list to keep `mosaic` out of the style picker (`#173`).
- OID resolution by file existence: `resolve_overlay_kind()` in
  `app/overlay_backends/utils.py` determines `CUSTOM` (overlay JSON exists on disk),
  `UNO` (22-char alphanumeric format), or `INVALID` — eliminating the required `C-`
  prefix. Legacy `C-` IDs continue to work (`#164`).
- `APP_TITLE` env var: configures the browser tab title, SPA `<title>`, PWA
  manifest `name`/`short_name`, and `/manage` page heading without rebuilding the
  frontend (default: `Volley Scoreboard`) (`#165`).
- Frontend error reporting: `window.onerror` / `unhandledrejection` pipeline
  ships errors to `POST /api/v1/log` so JavaScript exceptions surface in the
  backend log stream. `ErrorBoundary` wraps `ScoreboardView` and `ConfigPanel` and
  forwards React-caught errors through the same reporter (`#171`, `#176`).
- Logging — JSON output + correlation IDs: `dictConfig`-based logging pipeline
  (`app/logging_config.py`) with two formatters: `text` (ANSI, default) and `json`
  (one object per line, suitable for Loki/Datadog/CloudWatch). Every request gets a
  `X-Request-ID` correlation header and `request_id` injected into log records by
  `CorrelationMiddleware`. Uvicorn's access log is routed into the same pipeline
  (`#170`).
- Secret scrubbing: `RedactFilter` on the root logger scrubs `Bearer …` tokens
  and `password=`/`api_key=`/`token=`/`secret=` key-value pairs from every log
  record, complementing the existing `redact_url`/`redact_oid` helpers (`#171`).
- WS zombie detection: `WSControlClient` tracks `_last_inbound_ts`; `is_connected`
  returns `False` and the read loop breaks to trigger reconnect when no inbound
  traffic arrives within 55 s, preventing a hung socket from silently failing sends
  while blocking the HTTP fallback (`#167`).
- Per-OID session creation locks: each overlay ID now gets its own `asyncio.Lock`
  for the first-init path, preventing duplicate backend initialisation under
  concurrent requests (`#167`).
- Observability timing spans: `perf_counter` spans wrap `Backend.save_model`
  (split into `.model` and `.push` phases), `get_current_model`,
  `get_current_customization`, and `GameService.get_state`. Logs at DEBUG below
  threshold (500 ms remote / 50 ms in-process), WARNING above (`#180`).
- HTTP compression: `GZipMiddleware(minimum_size=1024)` attached outermost in
  `app/bootstrap.py` so it compresses final response bodies after observability
  middlewares (`#180`).
- Static asset caching: `CachedStaticFiles` subclass stamps
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on `/fonts` and the
  Vite-fingerprinted `/assets` mount. `index.html` gets `no-cache, must-revalidate`
  so clients always pick up new hashed asset URLs after a frontend rebuild (`#180`).
- `STRICT_OID_ACCESS` env var: flips the default so any authenticated user
  without an explicit `control` field is denied with `403`. Off by default to
  preserve single-tenant setups; see `AUTHENTICATION.md` (`#174`).
- Frontend a11y: score buttons gained `aria-label` / `aria-live="polite"` so
  assistive tech announces score changes (`#176`).
- DX — ruff + mypy expansion: ruff `select` now includes `I` (isort) and `B`
  (flake8-bugbear); mypy checks cover `app/api/routes` and `app/api/middleware` in
  addition to the existing `app/api` service layer (`#176`).
- OpenAPI snapshot + TypeScript tooling: `frontend/openapi.json` snapshot and a
  CI schema-drift guard ensure the generated API types stay in sync with the backend
  (`#147`).
- `?oid=` URL param: documented in `FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT.md` — passing `?oid=`
  in the control URL pre-selects an overlay and persists it, replacing any previously
  stored value (`#178`).
- Additional UI languages: European Portuguese, Italian, French and German
  translations for the React frontend, using volleyball-specific terminology per
  locale (e.g. `desconto de tempo` PT, `time-out` IT, `temps mort` FR, `Auszeit`
  DE for the volleyball timeout; `marcador` / `tabellone` / `tableau de score` /
  `Anzeigetafel` for the scoreboard). Language picker labels each option with
  its native name.

### Changed

- Architecture — NiceGUI fully removed: the remaining NiceGUI UI layer
  (~6 000 lines) is deleted, completing the migration started in v4.0.0. The
  React frontend is now the sole operator interface; `main.py` becomes pure
  FastAPI + Uvicorn glue with no NiceGUI dependency (`#139`).
- Architecture — overlay server merged in: the standalone overlay server is
  folded into the backend, eliminating the double-hop latency (Backend → Overlay
  Server → OBS) and an entire service deployment (`#143`).
- Frontend — full TypeScript migration: all `.js`/`.jsx` files under
  `frontend/src/` converted to `.ts`/`.tsx`. Typed prop interfaces, exported API
  types, OpenAPI-generated `GameState` schema, and type-safe test mocks across eight
  incremental PRs (`#150`–`#156`).
- Backend factory: `create_app()` extracted into `app/bootstrap.py` so tests
  build an isolated app via `TestClient(create_app())` without relying on `main.py`
  import side effects (`#147`).
- `overlay_backends/` split: the 721-line monolith split into a per-strategy
  package (`uno.py`, `local.py`, `base.py`, `utils.py`), mirroring the routes split
  pattern (`#147`).
- `app/api/routes.py` split: the 394-line routes file split into domain
  submodules under `app/api/routes/` — `lifespan`, `session`, `state`, `game`,
  `display`, `customization`, `overlays`, `links`, `admin` (`#157`).
- Docker image slimmed: stage 2 switches from `COPY . .` to an explicit whitelist
  (`main.py`, `app/`, `font/`, `overlay_static/`, `overlay_templates/`,
  `frontend/dist`). `.dockerignore` expanded to exclude docs, tests, scripts, and
  compose files from the build context (`#158`).
- Service worker unified: the legacy hand-written `app/pwa/sw.js` removed;
  `vite-plugin-pwa`'s Workbox-generated worker is the single service worker.
  `/sw.js` endpoint and `app/pwa/` directory deleted (`#159`).
- Typed state model: `State`'s internal `dict[str, str]` replaced with a `Serve`
  enum and `GameState` dataclass. Legacy dict format preserved at system boundaries
  via `_from_dict()`/`_to_dict()` — no changes in `GameManager`, `GameService`,
  backends, or overlay code (`#166`).
- Logger hygiene: all loggers switched to `getLogger(__name__)` (replaces
  hardcoded strings like `"Storage"`, `"APIRoutes"`). Log calls use lazy `%`-style
  args; OID values redacted from URLs before logging (`#169`).
- Backend HTTP client: `Backend.session` mounts an `HTTPAdapter` with
  `pool_connections=10`, `pool_maxsize=20`, and
  `Retry(total=2, backoff_factor=0.3, status_forcelist=(502,503,504))` on both
  `http://` and `https://` (`#180`).
- Backend customization cache: `GameService.refresh_customization` now has a 5 s
  TTL read-through cache per session, coalescing bursts of identical fetches.
  Writes prime the timestamp so the next read is immediately consistent (`#175`).
- `ConfigPanel` lazy sections: the six config sections (Teams / Overlay /
  Position / Buttons / Behavior / Links) are `React.lazy` chunks behind a `Suspense`
  boundary with a shimmer skeleton fallback. Production build emits a separate JS
  bundle per section (~14 kB deferred from initial open) (`#175`).
- Score tap debounce: single-tap debounce drops from 400 ms to 220 ms, halving
  perceived latency for a normal point while still distinguishing double-taps (~150 ms
  typical) (`#172`).
- Neumorphic CSS tokens deduped: shared token variables extracted into
  `jersey_shared.css`, eliminating repetition across jersey overlay stylesheets
  (`#168`).
- Fonts: all 10 scoreboard `@font-face` rules use `font-display: swap` so scores
  stay visible during font fetch instead of hiding under FOIT (`#180`).
- Noisy log lines demoted: INFO logs on `Backend.save_model`, `save_json_model`,
  `save_json_customization`, `get_current_model`, `get_current_customization` demoted
  to DEBUG so timing WARNINGs are not drowned out during a match (`#180`).
- Backend i18n removed: `app/messages.py` `Messages` class and
  `SCOREBOARD_LANGUAGE` env var dropped. The Spanish placeholder defaults (`Local` /
  `Visitante`) are replaced with empty strings; users set team names via `APP_TEAMS`
  or the runtime Teams config panel (`#177`).
- Set buttons respect the button font: the center-panel set counters now
  render in the same `fontFamily` selected for the score buttons (via
  `FontSelector` / `settings.selectedFont`), instead of the browser default.
  `CenterPanel` gained an optional `fontStyle` prop that `ScoreboardView`
  forwards through; the `.set-button` CSS `font-size` is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Overlay WebSocket URL: after capability-URL hardening, `serve_overlay` now
  passes the SHA-256 `output_key` into the template context so `wsUrl` is built
  from the correct key. The prior raw `target_id` caused `/ws/` to close with code
  4004 and no state to reach the page (`#161`).
- Preview initial load: `usePreview` now waits for the session to be ready before
  firing `GET /api/v1/links`. The prior race with `initSession` caused the preview to
  be blank on first load and appear only after a manual refresh (`#162`).
- `/manage` service worker bypass: `/manage` added to `navigateFallbackDenylist`
  in the Workbox config so the PWA no longer intercepts navigation to the overlay
  manager and serves `index.html` instead of the FastAPI-rendered page (`#182`).
- `GameService.set_score` bounds: `set_number` is now validated against both
  lower (`< 1`) and upper (`> sets_limit`) bounds. Previously only the upper bound
  was enforced (`#174`).
- WSHub concurrent broadcast: per-socket `_BROADCAST_SEND_TIMEOUT` prevents a
  stuck subscriber from stalling updates to the rest; the cleanup pass no longer
  pops an OID whose set was replaced by a concurrent reconnect (`#174`).
- Customization cache sentinel: initial call always hits the backend even on
  systems where `time.monotonic()` starts near zero — sentinel defaults to `None`
  instead of `0.0` (`#175`).

### Security

- Authentication audit: `AUTHENTICATION.md` documents full route/mount coverage
  with findings F-1–F-5. `/list/overlay` now requires `OVERLAY_MANAGER_PASSWORD`
  (F-4) — previously unauthenticated (`#148`).
- Capability URL hardening: `resolve_overlay_id` now supports SHA-256 output
  keys for `/overlay/{…}` and `/ws/{…}` capability URLs, enabling unguessable
  public links. Dead pass-through `AuthMiddleware` removed (`#149`).
- Overlay-id sanitizer: `OverlayStateStore._sanitize_id` replaced the prior
  `os.path.basename` stripping with a strict allow-list regex
  (`^(?!\.{1,2}$)[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}$`). Invalid IDs raise `ValueError` at the
  single choke point between user input and on-disk paths (`#180`).
- Iframe src validation: `OverlayPreview` runs `overlayUrl` through a scheme
  check that only accepts `http:`/`https:`. The Uno-overlay hostname match tightened
  from substring to exact hostname/subdomain so `evil-overlays.uno` cannot ride the
  Uno code path (`#180`).
- `secrets.compare_digest`: constant-time comparison used in `require_admin`,
  `check_api_key`, and the overlay server token check to prevent timing attacks
  (`#149`).

---

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Uno and Custom overlay backends decoupled into separate strategy classes
  sharing a common base interface; `oid` parameter threaded through all
  backend interface methods (`#136`).
- nicegui bumped to 3.10.0 (`#138`).

---

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- React scoreboard GUI: new `volley-control-ui` SPA replaces the NiceGUI
  operator interface. Includes scoreboard view, config panel, overlay preview,
  links/theme dialogs, and button font selector matching the old frontend.
- REST API + WebSocket layer: full decoupling of frontend from backend.
  Session management, OID authorization, and WebSocket authentication added.
  `GET /api/v1/overlays` returns the list of predefined overlays.
- `preferredStyle` in REST API: the overlay style preference is now
  readable and writable through the API, not only stored in-process.
- Uno/Custom backend decoupling: `UnoBackend` and `CustomOverlayBackend`
  extracted into separate strategy classes, sharing a common base interface
  (`#136`).

### Fixed

- WebSocket reconnect loop on session loss.
- `preferredStyle` no longer overwritten by the OID default on reconnect.
- `extract_oid` regex aligned with `validate_oid` so all valid OID characters
  are accepted uniformly.
- Customization refreshed from the overlay server on every page load.
- Custom overlay output URL resolved correctly after backend split.
- Session race conditions under concurrent init requests.
- Customization refresh and `get_styles` calls moved into `ThreadPoolExecutor`
  to avoid blocking the async event loop.

### Changed

- `requests` bumped from 2.32.5 to 2.33.1.
- Alternative NiceGUI frontend subproject removed from the repository.

---

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Test coverage skeleton for seven priority areas (preview page, WebSocket
  client, custom overlay manager, auth, API routes, state model, broadcast hub)
  with inline comments identifying what each suite should verify (`#125`).

### Fixed

- Dockerfile base image pinned to the same nicegui version as `requirements.txt`
  so `docker build` and `pip install` stay in sync. Dependabot docker ecosystem
  added so future nicegui releases keep both files aligned (`#126`).

### Changed

- nicegui bumped from 3.8.0 to 3.9.0.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `show_logos` in custom overlay API: the "Logos" toggle from the
  customization page is now forwarded to custom overlays via the `show_logos`
  boolean in `overlay_control`, allowing overlays to hide/show team logos
  dynamically. Field added to `CUSTOM_OVERLAY_API.yaml` (`#123`).

---

## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Output key aliases: overlay output URLs now use a deterministic hash
  (output key) so public URLs are not easily guessable. The remote-scoreboard
  URL is preserved across renames (`#122`).

### Fixed

- WebSocket connection timeout was not triggering reconnect; `recv()` timeout
  now correctly handled to keep the heartbeat loop alive (`#122`).

---

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- `_listen()` was catching `TimeoutError` but `websocket-client` raises
  `WebSocketTimeoutException` — a separate class that does not inherit from
  `TimeoutError`. Timeouts fell through to the generic handler, breaking the
  listen loop and triggering reconnects every ~25 s instead of sending
  heartbeats. Fixed by catching `self._ws_lib.WebSocketTimeoutException`
  (`#121`).

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- WebSocket-first state sync for custom overlays: `Backend` now opens a
  persistent WebSocket control channel (`/ws/control/{id}`) to custom overlay
  servers. Replaces per-update HTTP POSTs, reducing latency and overhead.
  Auto-discovers the endpoint via `/api/config/{id}` on startup (`#120`).
- **`WSControlClient`** (`app/ws_client.py`): background daemon thread,
  thread-safe sends, message dispatching. Protocol v1 supports `state_update`,
  `visibility`, `raw_config`, `get_state`, `ping/pong`, `obs_event`.
  Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1 s → 30 s max) and heartbeat
  pings every 25 s. 19 unit and integration tests (`#120`).
- Transparent HTTP fallback: if the WebSocket is unavailable all operations
  fall back to HTTP with no loss of functionality (`#120`).
- `controlWebSocketUrl` field added to `CUSTOM_OVERLAY_API.yaml` and
  `CUSTOM_OVERLAY.md` (`#120`).
- `websocket-client >= 1.6.0` and `python-dotenv 1.2.2` added to dependencies.

### Changed

- `gui.py` modularised into `app/components/button_interaction.py`,
  `button_style.py`, and `gui_update_mixin.py` (`#113`).
- Visual-only button settings (font, colors, icon opacity) isolated per
  browser tab — changes no longer propagate to other connected browsers via
  score broadcasts (`#116`).
- Improved multi-browser scoreboard synchronisation (`#115`).

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- Font, button colors, and icon opacity/visibility settings no longer
  propagate from one browser tab to another when a score broadcast fires.
  Each GUI instance now caches its visual preferences at connection time and
  refreshes only on explicit user change (`#116`).

---

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- Scoreboard synchronisation improved: state is now synced in memory before
  broadcasting, eliminating a race that could cause tabs to show stale scores
  (`#114`, `#115`).

---

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- `Client has been deleted but is still being used` warning eliminated.
  `_broadcast_to_others` now checks `Client.instances` before calling
  `update_ui`, skipping stale clients from closed browser tabs (`#112`).

---

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- `AssertionError` in `AppStorage._get_storage()` when NiceGUI user session
  storage has not been initialised yet — now falls back to in-memory storage
  gracefully, preventing 500 errors on page load (`#111`).
- Recursive call chain `get_current_customization` → `save_json_customization`
  → `update_local_overlay` → `get_current_customization` broken, eliminating
  maximum-recursion-depth crashes on custom overlay updates (`#111`).
- Customization cached on `Backend` instance after first fetch, removing a
  redundant `GET /api/raw_config` on every score press (3 requests → 2) (`#111`).
- `update_local_overlay` uses `self.session.post` instead of bare
  `requests.post`, reusing the connection pool for the `/api/state` call (`#111`).

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- PWA support: manifest, service worker, app icons, fullscreen display
  mode, Screen Wake Lock to keep display active during matches, and haptic
  feedback on score buttons (`#110`).
- Double-tap to undo: double-tapping a score button reverses the last
  score action; long-press timer raised to 1.0 s to avoid conflict (`#110`).
- Custom overlay support: `APP_CUSTOM_OVERLAY_URL` and
  `APP_CUSTOM_OVERLAY_OUTPUT_URL` env vars; dynamic overlay ID fetching;
  multiple schema payload support; `preferredStyle` for custom overlays;
  secure URL reconstruction with proxy-headers support (`#110`).
- **OpenAPI 3.0 spec** for the custom overlay contract
  (`CUSTOM_OVERLAY_API.yaml`) and full integration guide (`CUSTOM_OVERLAY.md`)
  (`#110`).
- Multi-user state broadcast: GUI instance registry synchronises state
  across multiple concurrent browser sessions (`#110`).
- `/health` endpoint: HTTP readiness check integrated with Docker
  healthcheck (`#110`).
- Startup configuration validation: all configuration validated at startup
  with early error reporting (`#110`).
- Adaptive layouts: adaptive layout options for CHAMPIONSHIP mode; explicit
  current-set mapping to Sets Display for layout `446a382f` (`#110`).
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline with Playwright and pytest (`#110`).

### Changed

- UI components extracted into `app/components/` module (`#110`).
- `Messages` class added for i18n-ready UI strings (`#110`).
- `constants.py` introduced to centralise repeated literals (`#110`).
- Thread pool and timeouts added for all backend operations (`#110`).
- Custom font scales normalised with exact flexbox metrics (`#110`).
- `.dockerignore` added for smaller Docker images (`#110`).
- `requirements-dev.txt` separated from `requirements.txt`; all dependency
  versions pinned (`#110`).
- nicegui bumped to 3.8.0.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Adaptive CHAMPIONSHIP layout: layout options for CHAMPIONSHIP mode that
  disable team color fields and rename labels to match the broadcast format
  (`#106`).

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Changed

- nicegui bumped from 3.7.x to 3.8.0 (`#105`).

---

### Added

- PWA: full Progressive Web App support with manifest, service worker, and
  app icons merged from dev branch (`#103`, `#104`).
- Screen Wake Lock: keeps the display on during a match (`#103`).
- Double-tap to undo: reverses the last score action; long-press timer
  adjusted to 1.0 s to avoid conflicts with double-tap (`#103`).
- Haptic feedback: vibration on score button presses (`#104`).

### Changed

- Custom font offset/scaling normalised using exact algorithmic flexbox metrics
  so all fonts are centred correctly and padding is bounded precisely (`#99`).
- GitHub Actions updated: `actions/checkout` → v6, `actions/setup-python` → v6
  (`#100`, `#101`).

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- Dark/Light theme toggle and fullscreen button moved from the scoreboard
  toolbar into the customization page for a cleaner main layout (`#98`).

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Overlay preview broken after nicegui upgrade due to issue
  zauberzeug/nicegui#5749; downgraded to nicegui 3.6.1 as a workaround (`#96`).

### Changed

- Resize trigger refactored to debounce minor size changes, preventing
  redundant layout recalculations (`#96`).

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-06

  directory structure, core logic (`State`, `GameManager`, `Backend`), and
  common modification scenarios (`#88`).

### Fixed

- Race condition on page load where set scores were not synchronised correctly;
  a delayed update in the initialisation phase ensures the UI reflects stored
  state (`#88`).

### Changed

- Dockerfile migrated to `uv pip install` to align with the latest
  `zauberzeug/nicegui` base image (`#88`).
- UI text centering on score buttons improved via updated
  `GAME_BUTTON_CLASSES` (`#88`).

---

## [1.7.3] - 2025-12-09

- Auto-resize buttons: button size scales automatically based on screen
  dimensions (`#84`).

---

## [1.6.1] - 2025-11-28

  control token automatically when not supplied (`#81`).

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-24

  orientations and different screen sizes (`#80`).

---

## [1.4.3] - 2025-11-04

### Fixed

- Unit tests updated to work with the NiceGUI 3.2.0 API changes (`#76`).

---

<!-- Versions below v1.4.3 predate formal GitHub releases and git tags.
     Entries are reconstructed from merged pull requests. -->

## [1.4.2] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- Overlay preview: inline preview panel showing the live overlay output
  inside the scoreboard UI. Auto-simplifies the scoreboard variant to the full
  board on timeouts (`#66`).
- Dedicated `/preview` link in the links section (`#72`).

### Fixed

  (`#68`, `#72`, `#74`, `#75`).

---

## [1.4.1] - 2025-09-10

### Added

- UI tests: Playwright-based UI test suite covering the main scoreboard
  flows (`#59`).
- **Long-press UI tests** and custom-value flow tests (`#60`).
- OID selection logic refactored to have clear priorities and persist
  selections across page reloads (`#61`).
- `REMOTE_CONFIG_URL` env var: loads environment variables from a remote JSON
  config file at startup (`#64`).
- `SINGLE_OVERLAY_MODE` env var: disables the `UNO_OVERLAY_OID` preference so
  a single custom overlay always takes precedence (`#64`).

### Fixed

- Long press on game/set buttons not triggering set/match win conditions
  (`#62`).
- Setting a custom value via long press no longer blocks the next single tap
  from registering (`#60`).

### Changed

- Long-press feature refactored; nicegui bumped to 2.24.1 (`#63`).

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-29

### Added

- Long press to set custom value: long-pressing a score button opens a
  numeric input to set an arbitrary value directly (`#55`).
- **Unit tests for state management** (non-UI) (`#55`).

### Changed

- Complete code overhaul decoupling GUI rendering from model mutations; `State`
  and `GameManager` now operate independently of NiceGUI callbacks (`#55`).
- Light interface refactor (`#55`).

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added

- Behavior dialog: new options dialog covering auto-hide HUD, auto-simple
  mode, fullscreen, and dark/light toggle — consolidated from scattered toolbar
  buttons (`#43`).
- Theme support: light and dark themes selectable at runtime (`#52`).
- Project renamed to **volley-overlay-control** (`#52`).

### Fixed

- Dark mode setting not persisted correctly across reloads (`#44`).

### Changed

- Session cookie sent with backend requests to preserve server-side session
  (`#51`).
- Backend code refactored; reset links no longer require two redirects (`#51`).

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-02

  and orientation (`#29`).
- Persistent dark mode: dark/light preference saved and restored across
  page reloads (`#24`).
- Sort teams list: overlay team names displayed in alphabetical order in
  the configuration combo box (`#26`).
- More compact layout variant for small screens (`#28`).
- Reload dialog for triggering a page refresh from within the UI (`#30`).

### Fixed

- Reset dialog messages improved for clarity (`#30`).
- Resize extended to portrait orientation, not only landscape (`#31`).
- Uninitialised button reference no longer causes errors on startup (`#30`).

### Changed

  control and output URLs directly in the UI (`#17`).
- Predefined overlay selections: list of known overlay IDs selectable from
  a dropdown (`#17`).

  (`#14`).
- `?control=` and `?output=` URL parameters to pre-fill overlay URLs on load
  (`#14`).
- Option to launch without defining a default overlay (`#14`).

---
